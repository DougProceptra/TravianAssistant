# Session Handoff - August 20, 2025

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. Vercel Proxy is LIVE
- **URL**: `https://travian-proxy.vercel.app/api/anthropic`
- **Repo**: https://github.com/DougProceptra/travian-proxy
- **Status**: Fully functional, tested and working
- **Test Command**: 
```bash
curl -X POST https://travian-proxy.vercel.app/api/anthropic \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hello"}],"max_tokens":50}'
```

### 2. Chrome Extension Structure
- Located in `/packages/extension/`
- Manifest V3 configured correctly
- Background service worker ready at `src/background.ts`
- Content script ready at `src/content/index.ts`
- HUD component ready at `src/content/components/HUD.tsx`

### 3. Extension Already Updated
- `background.ts` already points to: `https://travian-assistant-proxy.vercel.app/api/anthropic`
- Note: There's a typo in the URL (assistant vs proxy) - needs fixing

## ‚ùå What Failed (Don't Retry These)

### 1. Original Vercel Deployment (`travian-assistant-proxy`)
- **Problem**: Monorepo structure confuses Vercel
- **Symptom**: Functions tab shows no functions even though `/api/anthropic.js` exists
- **Root Cause**: When Vercel detects `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `packages/`, it treats the project as a build project, not a serverless function project
- **Time Wasted**: ~3 hours

### 2. Things That DON'T Work
- Changing Framework Preset to "Other" - doesn't help with monorepo
- Modifying build commands - Vercel still ignores `/api` folder
- Adding `type: "module"` to package.json - doesn't fix detection
- Edge Runtime syntax - unnecessary complexity
- Checking curl responses when Functions tab is empty - pointless

## üîß What Needs Fixing

### 1. Extension Background Service
**File**: `/packages/extension/src/background.ts`
**Issue**: Line 6 has wrong URL
**Current**: `https://travian-assistant-proxy.vercel.app/api/anthropic`
**Should be**: `https://travian-proxy.vercel.app/api/anthropic`

### 2. Build and Test Extension
```bash
# In the TravianAssistant repo
cd packages/extension
pnpm build

# Output will be in packages/extension/dist/
# Load this folder as unpacked extension in Chrome
```

### 3. Test on Travian
1. Go to any Travian Legends server
2. Open Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Console
3. Should see `[TLA]` prefixed messages
4. Check if HUD appears
5. Test "Analyze" button

## üìö Key Learnings

### 1. Always Check Functions Tab First
Before ANY testing, go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Functions tab. If empty, the function doesn't exist. Period.

### 2. Vercel + Monorepo = Broken
Vercel cannot properly detect serverless functions in monorepo projects. It will:
- Run the build script instead
- Deploy build output instead of functions
- Ignore `/api` folder completely

### 3. Simple Repos Work
A repo with just `/api/function.js` and nothing else will work immediately with zero configuration.

### 4. Environment Variables
- Must be set BEFORE deployment or requires redeploy
- Watch for leading/trailing spaces in API keys
- Vercel shows "invalid x-api-key" when key is wrong (not missing)

## üìã Next Session Tasks

### 1. Fix Background Service URL (2 min)
```javascript
// Line 6 of packages/extension/src/background.ts
const PROXY_URL = 'https://travian-proxy.vercel.app/api/anthropic';
```

### 2. Build Extension (5 min)
```bash
cd packages/extension
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### 3. Test Extension (10 min)
- Load `/packages/extension/dist/` in Chrome
- Navigate to Travian Legends
- Open console, check for errors
- Test HUD appears
- Test "Analyze" button

### 4. Debug Any Issues
Common issues:
- **CORS errors**: Already handled in proxy
- **No HUD**: Check if content script is injecting
- **No response**: Check console for `[TLA BG]` logs

### 5. Enhance Game State Scraping
Current scraper in `/packages/extension/src/content/scraper.ts` is basic. Needs:
- Better resource detection
- Build queue parsing
- Troop counts
- Incoming attacks detection

## üö® Critical Information

### API Key (Store Securely)
- Key is stored in Vercel environment variables
- Variable name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Location: travian-proxy project settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

### Working Proxy Endpoint
```
https://travian-proxy.vercel.app/api/anthropic
```

### Repos
- **Main**: https://github.com/DougProceptra/TravianAssistant
- **Proxy**: https://github.com/DougProceptra/travian-proxy

### Vercel Projects
- **Working**: `travian-proxy` (simple repo)
- **Broken**: `travian-assistant-proxy` (monorepo - don't use)
- **Also Broken**: `travian-assistant-extension` (monorepo - don't use)

## üí° Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Don't try to fix Vercel monorepo detection** - It's fundamentally broken
2. **Use the working proxy** - It's already deployed and functional
3. **Focus on the extension** - That's where the actual functionality lives
4. **Test on a real Travian server** - Mock data isn't sufficient

## Time Estimate
- Fixing URL: 2 minutes
- Building extension: 5 minutes  
- Loading in Chrome: 2 minutes
- Testing on Travian: 10 minutes
- **Total: ~20 minutes to have working extension**

## For the Next AI/Developer

### DO:
- Check Functions tab before testing endpoints
- Use the simple `travian-proxy` repo
- Read error messages completely
- Test with curl first, then in extension

### DON'T:
- Try to make Vercel work with the monorepo
- Run curl commands when Functions tab is empty
- Change build settings randomly
- Make multiple changes at once

### Key Insight
The entire problem was Vercel's auto-detection failing with monorepos. The solution was a separate, simple repo with just the API function. This took 3 hours to figure out but should have taken 5 minutes if we'd checked the Functions tab first.
