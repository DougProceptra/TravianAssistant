# TravianAssistant Development Roadmap v3.0
*Updated: August 21, 2025*

## Vision
Transform TravianAssistant from a village advisor into an intelligent strategic companion that understands your game, answers your questions, and provides battlefield intelligence.

## Current Status (v0.4.0)
✅ **Completed Phase 1**: Multi-village data collection with IndexedDB persistence
- Village navigation and switching

- [ ] Test common questions and responses

#### Day 5-6: Distribution Package
- [ ] Create one-click installation package
- [ ] Write user documentation
- [ ] Set up shared API key management
- [ ] Create feedback collection system

#### Day 7: Team Onboarding
- [ ] Installation workshop/guide
- [ ] Feature walkthrough
- [ ] Collect initial feedback
- [ ] Priority bug list

## Phase 2: Conversational AI Interface (Week 2)

### Natural Language Understanding
```typescript
interface ConversationalAI {
  // Example queries to support:
  queries: [
    "How can I increase troop count faster?",
    "What's the fastest way to settle my next village?",
    "Should I focus on economy or military right now?",
    "What buildings should I prioritize?",
    "When will I have enough culture points?",
    "What's my biggest bottleneck?",
    "How do I optimize my resource production?",
    "What troops should I build for defense?",
    "How many days until I can settle village #4?"
  ];
  
  // Context-aware responses based on:
  context: {
    currentGameState: EnhancedGameState;
    historicalTrends: TrendData;
    playerProfile: PlayerPreferences;
    serverMeta: ServerInfo;
  };
}
```

### Implementation Components

#### 2.1 Chat Interface
```typescript
// In-HUD chat panel
interface ChatInterface {
  // Persistent chat history
  messages: ChatMessage[];
  
  // Quick action buttons
  quickQuestions: [
    "What should I do next?",
    "Analyze my growth",
    "Check for threats",
    "Optimize resources"
  ];
  
  // Voice input option (future)
  voiceEnabled: boolean;
}
```

#### 2.2 Context-Aware Prompting
```typescript
// Enhanced prompts with full game context
function buildConversationalPrompt(
  question: string,
  gameState: EnhancedGameState,
  history: ChatMessage[]
): string {
  return `
You are an expert Travian advisor with access to the player's complete game state.

PLAYER CONTEXT:
${formatGameState(gameState)}

HISTORICAL TRENDS:
${formatTrends(gameState.trends)}

CONVERSATION HISTORY:
${formatChatHistory(history)}

PLAYER QUESTION: ${question}

Provide a specific, actionable answer that:
1. Directly addresses their question
2. Uses their actual game data
3. Gives concrete numbers and timelines
4. Suggests specific next steps
`;
}
```

#### 2.3 Strategic Calculators
- **Settlement Calculator**: Days to next village, CP requirements
- **Troop Calculator**: Time and resources for troop goals
- **Building ROI**: Which upgrades give best returns
- **Resource Optimizer**: NPC trade recommendations

---

## Phase 3: Map Intelligence & Threat Assessment (Week 3-4)

### Battlefield Intelligence System

#### 3.1 Map Scanner
```typescript
interface MapIntelligence {
  // Scan radius around each village
  scanRadius: number; // e.g., 20 squares
  
  // Categorize nearby entities
  nearbyVillages: {
    friendly: Village[];
    enemy: Village[];
    neutral: Village[];
    abandoned: Village[]; // Farm candidates
  };
  
  // Threat assessment
  threats: {
    village: Village;
    threatLevel: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
    estimatedOffense: number;
    estimatedDefense: number;
    distance: number;
    travelTime: number;
  }[];
  
  // Opportunity identification
  opportunities: {
    farms: FarmTarget[];
    oases: Oasis[];
    settlementSpots: Coordinates[];
  };
}
```

#### 3.2 Automated Farm Finder
```typescript
interface FarmFinder {
  // Scan all villages on map (background process)
  scanAllVillages(): Promise<Village[]>;
  
  // Identify farming candidates
  identifyFarms(criteria: {
    maxPopulation: number;      // e.g., 100
    inactivityDays: number;     // e.g., 3
    maxDistance: number;        // e.g., 20 squares
    noAlliance: boolean;        // Prefer allianceless
  }): FarmTarget[];
  
  // Calculate farming efficiency
  calculateROI(farm: FarmTarget): {
    estimatedResources: number;
    travelTime: number;
    troopsNeeded: number;
    profitPerHour: number;
  };
}
```

#### 3.3 Ranking Comparisons
```typescript
interface RankingIntelligence {
  // Player's positions
  playerRanks: {
    overall: number;
    attack: number;
    defense: number;
    population: number;
  };
  
  // Comparative analysis
  comparisons: {
    vsTopPlayers: ComparisonData;
    vsAlliance: ComparisonData;
    vsNeighbors: ComparisonData;
    growthRate: number; // Percentile
  };
  
  // Strategic insights
  insights: [
    "You're growing 23% faster than server average",
    "Your defense rank is lagging - consider more troops",
    "3 players within 10 squares are growing faster"
  ];
}
```

#### 3.4 Alliance Intelligence
```typescript
interface AllianceIntel {
  // Alliance member analysis
  memberStrength: {
    topAttackers: Player[];
    topDefenders: Player[];
    inactiveMembers: Player[];
  };
  
  // Enemy alliance tracking
  enemyAlliances: {
    name: string;
    memberCount: number;
    totalStrength: number;
    territory: Coordinates[];
    recentActivity: Activity[];
  }[];
}
```

### Implementation Approach

#### Map Scanning Strategy
1. **Periodic Background Scans**: Every 2 hours, scan map sections
2. **Smart Caching**: Store village data with timestamps
3. **Delta Detection**: Track population/alliance changes
4. **Threat Scoring**: Algorithm based on population, distance, alliance

#### Data Collection Methods
```typescript
// Map scraping approach
async function scanMapSection(x: number, y: number, radius: number) {
  const villages = [];
  
  for (let dx = -radius; dx <= radius; dx++) {
    for (let dy = -radius; dy <= radius; dy++) {
      const coord = { x: x + dx, y: y + dy };
      
      // Navigate to map position
      await navigateToMapTile(coord);
      
      // Scrape village data
      const villageData = scrapeMapTile();
      if (villageData) {
        villages.push({
          ...villageData,
          distance: Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy),
          scannedAt: Date.now()
        });
      }
      
      // Rate limiting
      await delay(500);
    }
  }
  
  return villages;
}
```

## Technical Requirements for Team Testing

### 1. Easy Installation
```bash
# One-line install script
curl -s https://travian-assistant.com/install.sh | bash

# Or manual steps:
1. Download extension package
2. Extract to folder
3. Load in Chrome extensions
4. Enter shared API key
```

### 2. Configuration Sharing
```typescript
interface TeamConfig {
  apiKey: string;          // Shared Claude API key
  allianceId: string;      // For data sharing
  serverUrl: string;       // Game server
  updateChannel: string;   // For coordinated updates
}
```

### 3. Error Reporting
```typescript
// Automatic error collection
interface ErrorReport {
  userId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  error: Error;
  gameState: EnhancedGameState;
  browserInfo: BrowserInfo;
}

// Send to shared collection endpoint
async function reportError(error: Error) {
  await fetch('https://your-backend/errors', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(createErrorReport(error))
  });
}
```
