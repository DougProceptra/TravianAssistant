## Implementation Approach

### Step 1: Data Completeness (Foundation)
**Goal**: Capture 95%+ of available game data continuously

**Priority Data Sources**:
1. Overview page (`/dorf3.php`) - all villages summary
2. Map data - systematic scanning of all coordinates
3. Reports - parse all battle/scout/trade reports
4. Statistics - rankings, growth rates, alliances
5. Market - prices, merchants, trade routes

**Research Needed**:
- How travcotools.com accesses map data
- API endpoints used by game for AJAX calls
- Browser automation for systematic scanning
- Data storage architecture for millions of records

### Step 2: AI Brain Development
**Goal**: Claude-powered strategic reasoning with game-specific knowledge

**Components**:
1. **Game Knowledge Base**
   - Troop statistics, building costs, production formulas
   - Combat mechanics, hero mechanics, culture formulas
   - Phase-specific strategies, tribe-specific optimizations

2. **Strategic Reasoning Engine**
   - Multi-dimensional optimization algorithms
   - Predictive modeling for opponent behavior
   - Resource flow analysis
   - Combat outcome simulation

3. **Learning System**
   - Track decisions and outcomes
   - Adjust strategies based on results
   - Player-specific pattern recognition

### Step 3: Opening Game Perfection (Proof of Value)
**Goal**: Demonstrate 20-30% faster second village settlement

**Features**:
