## üéØ Documentation Philosophy

Following the AI-first approach:
1. **Keep it simple** - Documentation should be clear and focused
2. **Document reality** - What actually works, not what we hope to build
3. **One source of truth** - No duplicate or conflicting information
4. **Archive don't delete** - Old docs moved to archive for reference

## üìù Documentation Standards

### For New Documentation
- Start with current state, not aspirations
- Include concrete examples
- Mark broken features clearly
- Date all documents

### When Updating
- Update in place for active docs
- Move outdated docs to archive
- Keep SESSION_CONTEXT.md current
- Update BUG_TRACKER.md with new issues
