# TravianAssistant V4: AI-Powered Game Assistant
*Last Updated: August 31, 2025*
*Server Launch: September 1, 2025*

## Paradigm Shift: From Calculators to AI Intelligence

### Core Concept
TravianAssistant V4 is NOT a calculator tool. It's an **AI-powered game assistant** that:
- **Observes** your current game state through the Chrome extension
- **Understands** the complete game mechanics through our data provider
- **Analyzes** your specific situation using Claude AI
- **Recommends** optimal actions based on YOUR unique circumstances
- **Adapts** to changing game conditions in real-time

## Architecture

```
Game Browser → Chrome Extension → Game State Scraper

              Game Data Provider
                      ↓
                 Claude AI Agent
                      ↓
              Interactive Chat HUD
                      ↓
            Contextual Recommendations
```

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection (Chrome Extension)
The extension continuously scrapes:
- Current resources and production rates
- Building levels and construction queues
- Troop counts and training queues
- Available actions on current page
- Server time and speed
- Player's tribe and village information

### 2. Context Building (Game Data Provider)
Provides Claude with:
- Complete game formulas and mechanics
- All troop stats for all tribes
- Building costs and construction times
- Hero mechanics and bonuses
- Combat calculations
- Trade and merchant data

### 3. AI Analysis (Claude Agent)
Claude receives:
- Real-time game state from extension
- Complete game rules from data provider
- Historical patterns from previous sessions
- Player preferences and goals

### 4. Interactive Dialogue
Instead of static calculations, the AI:
- **Asks clarifying questions** to understand your goals
- **Considers variables** we can't predict (alliance politics, neighbors, server meta)
- **Provides contextual advice** based on YOUR specific situation
- **Explains reasoning** behind recommendations
- **Adapts strategy** as conditions change

## Game Start Intelligence

### Dynamic Assessment Questions
When starting a new game, the AI will ask:

**Server Context:**
- "Is this a new server or did you join late?"
- "What's your spawn position relative to the gray zone?"
- "Are you playing solo or with an alliance?"
- "What's your gold budget for this server?"

**Strategic Goals:**
- "Are you aiming for top-10 settler or steady growth?"
- "Offensive, defensive, or support account?"
- "Planning to be a WWK/WWR or regular player?"
- "Region control or raiding focus?"

**Immediate Situation:**
- "What oases are near your spawn?"
- "Any aggressive neighbors spotted?"
- "Did you get good adventure rewards?"
- "Current quest progress?"

### Adaptive Recommendations
Based on answers, the AI provides:
- Customized build order for YOUR situation
- Resource balance specific to YOUR goals
- Settlement timing based on YOUR competition
- Troop composition for YOUR strategy

## Key Differences from V3

### ❌ What We're NOT Building:
- Static calculators with fixed formulas
- Pre-determined "optimal" build orders
- Generic one-size-fits-all strategies
- Standalone web interfaces
- Rigid optimization paths

### ✅ What We ARE Building:
- Dynamic AI analysis of current state
- Contextual recommendations based on situation
- Interactive dialogue for strategy refinement
- Adaptive planning that evolves with the game
- Learning system that improves over time

## Technical Implementation

### Chrome Extension Role
- **Scrapes** game state from browser
- **Formats** data for AI consumption
- **Displays** chat interface as HUD overlay
- **Sends** queries to backend AI service
- **Renders** AI responses in-game

### Backend Server Role
- **Hosts** game data files
- **Manages** AI conversation context
- **Stores** player preferences and patterns
- **Routes** requests to Claude API
- **Maintains** session continuity

### AI Agent Configuration
```javascript
// System prompt for Claude
"You are an expert Travian advisor with access to real-time game data.
You can see the player's current resources, buildings, troops, and page context.
You have complete knowledge of all game mechanics and formulas.
Ask clarifying questions when needed to provide optimal advice.
Consider the specific server conditions and player goals.
Explain your reasoning and provide specific, actionable recommendations."
```

## User Experience

### In-Game Chat Interface
Player: "Should I build troops or upgrade fields?"

AI: "I see you have 15/15/15/9 fields and a level 5 barracks. Let me ask:
1. Have you scouted your neighbors? Any threats?
2. Are you planning to raid or play defensively?
3. When are you aiming to settle - day 6 or later?

Based on your 312/hour crop production, you can support about 40 troops before going negative..."

### Context-Aware Responses
The AI sees what page you're on:
- **On Resources Page**: "Your clay production is bottlenecking. Upgrade clay pit 14 to 15 next."
- **On Map**: "That 15-cropper at (-23, 47) is ideal for your second village."
- **On Reports**: "You lost 3 Slaves in that raid. The defense suggests 2 Ash Wardens."
- **On Rally Point**: "Send your hero on the adventure - 67% chance of resources."
