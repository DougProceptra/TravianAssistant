## Implementation

### Game Start Optimizer (`game-start-optimizer.ts`)
Complete algorithmic implementation for achieving top-5 settler status:

**4-Phase System:**
1. **INITIAL (0-24h)**: Balanced resource development, quest optimization
2. **ACCELERATION (24-72h)**: Crop focus to level 5, NPC trading
3. **CP_RUSH (72-144h)**: Maximize culture points, build Embassy/Main Building
4. **SETTLEMENT (144-168h)**: Train settlers, secure optimal location

**Key Features:**
- Egyptian-specific field sequence optimization
- Real-time phase detection and adjustment
- Settlement time prediction (±2 hour accuracy)
- Resource imbalance detection with NPC recommendations
- Gold usage strategy per phase
- Quest prioritization system

### AI Prompt Enhancement (`ai-prompt-enhancer.ts`)
Strategic context injection for Claude AI:

**Context Layers:**
- Game mechanics knowledge base
- Phase-specific strategic focus
- Current state analysis
- Competitive positioning metrics
- Action prioritization framework

**Output Formats:**
- Quick analysis summaries
- Immediate action plans (next 2 hours)
- Daily task schedules (20 minutes total)
- Weekly goal tracking

### Integration Layer (`game-integration.ts`)
Seamless connection between components:

**Capabilities:**
- Automatic optimizer initialization for early game (<168h)
- Game state conversion and normalization
- Real-time recommendation generation
- HUD metric updates
- Special command handling ("analyze", "plan")

### Enhanced Chat UI (`conversational-ai-integrated.ts`)
Full-featured strategic assistant interface:

**Features:**
- Draggable, resizable window with persistence
- Quick analysis metrics bar
- Markdown-style formatting support
- Chat history preservation
- Special commands for deep analysis

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm installed
- Chrome browser (latest version)
- Replit account with Hacker plan ($7/month)
- Anthropic API key ($50/month estimated usage)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone and sync repository
git clone https://github.com/DougProceptra/TravianAssistant.git
cd TravianAssistant
git pull origin main

# 2. Install dependencies
cd packages/extension
npm install

# 3. Build extension with optimizer
chmod +x build-optimizer.sh
./build-optimizer.sh

# 4. Start backend server (in separate terminal)
cd ../../backend
node server-sqlite-fixed.js

# 5. Load extension in Chrome
# - Open chrome://extensions/
# - Enable Developer mode
# - Click "Load unpacked"
# - Select the dist/ folder
```

### Verification

```bash
# Test backend connectivity
curl http://localhost:3002/api/status

# Verify database
sqlite3 backend/travian.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM map_villages;"
# Should return: 7492
```

## API Documentation

### Chat Commands
| Command | Description | Response |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `analyze` | Full strategic analysis | Phase status, recommendations, milestones |
| `plan` | Action plan | Prioritized next actions with reasoning |
| `[any strategic question]` | AI advice | Context-aware strategic response |

### Game State API
```typescript
interface GameState {
  serverAge: number;        // Hours since server start
  resources: Resources;      // Current wood/clay/iron/crop
  production: Resources;     // Per hour production
  culturePoints: number;    // Current CP
  villages: VillageData[];  // All villages
  phase: Phase;            // Current game phase
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests (Game Optimizer)
```typescript
// Test phase detection
const optimizer = new GameStartOptimizer(mockGameState);
const phase = optimizer.getCurrentPhase();
expect(phase.name).toBe('INITIAL'); // For server age < 24h

// Test settlement prediction
const settlementTime = optimizer.predictSettlementTime();
expect(settlementTime).toBeLessThan(168); // Hours
```

### Integration Tests
```javascript
// In browser console on Travian page
// Test scraping
TravianAssistant.safeScraper.getGameState()
  .then(state => console.log('Villages:', state.villages.length));

// Test optimizer
TravianAssistant.gameIntegration.processGameState(gameState)
  .then(result => console.log('Recommendations:', result.recommendations));

// Test AI enhancement
TravianAssistant.AIPromptEnhancer.generateQuickAnalysis(gameContext)
  .then(analysis => console.log(analysis));
```

## Deployment

### Development
```bash
cd packages/extension
./build-optimizer.sh
# Reload extension in Chrome
```

### Production
```bash
# Build optimized version
NODE_ENV=production ./build-optimizer.sh

# Deploy backend to Replit
git push origin main
# Replit auto-deploys from GitHub
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Chat not appearing | No chat button visible | Check console for errors, rebuild extension |
| API errors | "Failed to get response" | Verify proxy URL in background.js |
| Wrong recommendations | Incorrect phase detection | Check server age calculation |
| Build fails | TypeScript errors | Ensure using -fixed.ts files |
| No villages found | Empty scraping results | Verify on overview page |

## Security & Performance

**Security Measures:**
- API key stored in environment variables only
- No direct external API calls from extension
- Sanitized user inputs before AI processing
- No automation of game actions (ToS compliant)

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Response caching (70% token reduction)
- Batch village analysis
- Lazy loading of optimizer
- Minimal DOM operations

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE ⚠️
**This document describes the PLANNED implementation. As of August 28, 2025:**
- Optimizer files are created but NOT deployed
- Backend connection is NOT established
- Data scraping needs expansion
- See `/docs/OPTIMIZER_NOT_DEPLOYED.md` for current status
- See `/docs/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` for actual next steps

**Priority remains: Backend → Data → Then Optimizer**
