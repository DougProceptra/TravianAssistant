# TravianAssistant Team Testing Guide

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Download Extension
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DougProceptra/TravianAssistant.git

# Or download the zip from GitHub
```

### Step 2: Build Extension
```bash
cd TravianAssistant/packages/extension
npm install
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Load in Chrome
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select `TravianAssistant/packages/extension/dist` folder
5. You should see the TravianAssistant icon in your extensions

### Step 4: Configure API Access
The extension uses a shared proxy at `https://travian-proxy-simple.vercel.app/api/proxy` - no API key needed on your end!

### Step 5: Test on Travian
1. Navigate to your Travian game
2. Look for the AI Assistant HUD on the right side
3. Click "Analyze Now" for instant recommendations
4. Click "Full Account Scan" to analyze all villages (takes ~30 seconds)

## What to Test and Report

### Priority Testing Areas

1. **Village Detection**
   - Does it find all your villages?
   - Does village switching work?
   - Check console for any errors

2. **Data Accuracy**
   - Are resources correct?
   - Is production calculated properly?
   - Do alerts make sense?

3. **AI Recommendations**
   - Are suggestions relevant?
   - Do they consider your full account?
   - Are they actionable?

4. **Performance**
   - How long does full scan take?
   - Any lag or freezing?
   - Memory usage reasonable?

### How to Report Issues

Please include:
1. **What happened**: Describe the issue
2. **Expected behavior**: What should have happened
3. **Steps to reproduce**: How can we recreate it
4. **Screenshots**: If applicable
5. **Console logs**: Press F12, go to Console tab, copy any red errors

## Console Commands for Debugging

Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and try these in Console:

```javascript
// Check if extension loaded
console.log('[TLA Test] Extension loaded:', typeof enhancedScraper);

// Test current village scraping
enhancedScraper.scrapeCurrentVillage();

// Check IndexedDB data
indexedDB.open('TravianAssistantDB').onsuccess = (e) => {
  console.log('Database opened:', e.target.result);
};

// Force full account scan
enhancedScraper.scrapeFullAccount(true).then(console.log);

// Check village detection
villageNavigator.getVillages();
```

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Extension Not Loading
- Make sure you're in Developer Mode
- Check that you selected the `dist` folder, not `src`
- Try refreshing the extension

### No HUD Appearing
- Refresh the Travian page
- Check if you're on a supported page (village view, not login)
- Look for errors in console (F12)

### Village Switching Fails
- The selectors might be different on your server
- Send us the HTML of your village list for debugging
- Try manual full scan button instead

### API Errors
- The shared proxy should work automatically
- If you see "Proxy error", the Vercel function might be rate limited
- Wait 1 minute and try again

## Advanced Features (Optional)

### Export Your Data
```javascript
// In console:
dataStore.exportData().then(data => {
  const blob = new Blob([data], {type: 'application/json'});
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const a = document.createElement('a');
  a.href = url;
  a.download = `travian-data-${Date.now()}.json`;
  a.click();
});
```

### Clear Old Data
```javascript
// Remove data older than 1 day
dataStore.cleanOldData(1);
```

### Check Storage Usage
```javascript
navigator.storage.estimate().then(estimate => {
  console.log(`Using ${(estimate.usage/1024/1024).toFixed(2)}MB of ${(estimate.quota/1024/1024).toFixed(2)}MB`);
});
```
