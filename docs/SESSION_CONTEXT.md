# SESSION_CONTEXT.md
*Last Updated: September 1, 2025 - Session Start*
*Server Launch: TODAY!*

## üö® CURRENT STATUS: Extension Ready, Need Integration Testing

### What Actually Exists (Verified)
1. **Chrome Extension** - v0.9.11 with working chat UI
2. **AI Agent IN EXTENSION** - Uses Claude via Vercel proxy (working)
3. **Game Data Provider** - Complete with all tribes/buildings/formulas
4. **Background Service** - Handles CHAT_MESSAGE and ANALYZE_GAME_STATE
5. **Multiple Scrapers** - elite-scraper, enhanced-scraper, safe-scraper
6. **Chat UI** - conversational-ai-fixed.ts (working per previous sessions)

### What Was Built Yesterday (Aug 31)
- ‚úÖ game-data-provider.ts - Complete game mechanics
- ‚úÖ test-ai-agent-local.js - Local simulation that WORKS
- ‚úÖ All data verified (Egyptian Slave Militia, settlement costs, etc.)

## üî¥ CRITICAL PATH FOR TODAY

### Step 1: Test Current Extension (30 mins)
```bash
cd packages/extension
./build-minimal.sh  # or whatever build script works
# Load dist/ in Chrome
# Go to Travian game
# Open console and verify:
# - HUD appears
# - Chat works
# - Data scraping active
```

### Step 2: Integration Testing (1 hour)
1. **Verify Scraping**
   - Is elite-scraper.ts collecting full game state?
   - Resources, buildings, troops, production rates?
   - Check console for scraped data

2. **Test AI Chat**
   - Ask "What should I build next?"
   - Does it see your actual game state?
   - Are recommendations specific to your situation?

3. **Game Data Integration**
   - Is game-data-provider being used?
   - Are calculations accurate?

### Step 3: Fix Any Gaps (1-2 hours)
Based on testing, likely issues:
- Scraper not getting all data ‚Üí enhance elite-scraper.ts
- AI not seeing game state ‚Üí fix message passing
- Calculations wrong ‚Üí integrate game-data-provider

## üìÇ KEY FILES TO CHECK

### Working Components (Don't Break These!)
- `/packages/extension/src/background.ts` - v0.8.5 working
- `/packages/extension/src/content/conversational-ai-fixed.ts` - Chat UI
- `/packages/extension/src/ai/game-data-provider.ts` - Game mechanics

### Scrapers (May Need Enhancement)
- `/packages/extension/src/content/elite-scraper.ts` - Main scraper
- `/packages/extension/src/content/enhanced-scraper.ts` - Additional data
- `/packages/extension/src/content/game-integration.ts` - Integration layer

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

By end of session, player can:
1. Open Travian with extension loaded
2. See HUD with game state
3. Ask AI "When should I settle?"
4. Get response with ACTUAL calculations:
   - "Based on your Egyptian tribe, current resources (750/750/750/750)"
   - "With production at 100/100/100/50 per hour"
   - "You need 9000/15120/19530/14490 for settlers"
   - "Expected settlement: Day 6-7"

## üí° REMEMBER

- **NO CODE DUMPS IN CHAT** - Everything goes to GitHub
- **AI already works** - Via Vercel proxy to Claude
- **Data layer complete** - Just needs integration
- **Chat UI works** - User confirmed in previous session
- **Server launches TODAY** - Focus on MVP

## üîß Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Pull latest
cd ~/TravianAssistant
git pull origin main

# Build extension
cd packages/extension
npm install  # if needed
./build-minimal.sh  # or npm run build

# Test locally
node ../../test-ai-agent-local.js  # Verify data loads

# Load in Chrome
# chrome://extensions ‚Üí Load unpacked ‚Üí select dist/
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT
- Rebuild what already works
- Create new backend services (Vercel proxy works)
- Rewrite the chat UI (it's working)
- Dump code in session (use GitHub)

## ‚úÖ DO
- Test what exists first
- Fix specific gaps found in testing
- Focus on integration not recreation
- Ship TODAY for server launch

*Ready for September 1 server launch. Extension exists, AI works, just need integration testing.*
