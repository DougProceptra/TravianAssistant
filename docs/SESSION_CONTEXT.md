# TravianAssistant Session Context

## ⚠️ PERMANENT PROJECT INFORMATION ⚠️
**Repository**: `dougproceptra/travianassistant` (GitHub)
- Always use this repository location
- Owner: dougproceptra
- Repo: travianassistant
- Main branch: main

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: CODE DEVELOPMENT RULES ⚠️
**ALL CODE IS WRITTEN TO GITHUB - NEVER DUMP CODE IN SESSION**
- Code goes in GitHub repos, NOT in chat sessions
- Use git commits for all implementation work
- Session is for discussion, decisions, and architecture
- Small script snippets for Replit execution are OK
- Full implementations must go directly to GitHub files
- Workflow: GitHub → Pull to Replit → Deploy

## TODAY'S PROGRESS: AI CLIENT INTEGRATION ✅

### What We Built (Session 2 - Aug 26 Evening)

1. **Elite AI Client** (`packages/extension/src/ai/ai-client.ts`)
   - Proper system message structure with elite instructions
   - Multiple decision prompts for different scenarios
   - Structured response format with recommendations, insights, warnings
   - Fallback logic for when AI is unavailable
   - Context persistence for learning

2. **Test Framework** (`packages/extension/src/ai/test-ai-client.ts`)
   - Realistic game state mocking
   - Multiple scenario testing (daily review, under attack, settlement, resources)
   - Free-form question testing
   - Confidence scoring and priority levels

3. **Background Service Update** (`packages/extension/src/background.ts v0.5.0`)
   - Integrated TravianAIClient
   - Added strategic analysis endpoints
   - Context storage and retrieval
   - Pattern learning from high-confidence insights
   - Multiple message types for different analysis needs

4. **Replit Test Script** (`test-ai-prompts.js`)
   - Simple Node.js script for quick testing
   - No dependencies required
   - Clear output formatting
   - Troubleshooting guidance

```

### System Message Structure
- **Identity**: Elite Travian strategist (top-20 player level)
- **Principles**: Psychology > Mechanics, Deception > Optimization
- **Analysis Layers**: Immediate, Short-term, Mid-term, Strategic, Server-winning
- **Focus**: Non-obvious insights, counter-plays, server-specific patterns

### Decision Types Implemented
1. `daily_review` - Strategic planning for next 24 hours
2. `under_attack` - Response strategies beyond defend/dodge
3. `settlement` - Challenge "always settle ASAP" doctrine
4. `resource_crisis` - Creative solutions beyond "build more"
5. `artifact_prep` - Positioning and misdirection strategies

## TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### Quick Test (Replit)
```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Run test script
node test-ai-prompts.js
```

### Full Integration Test
1. **Update Chrome Extension**
   - Pull latest from GitHub
   - Reload extension in Chrome
   - Check version shows v0.5.0

2. **Test AI Analysis**
   - Open Travian game
   - Click extension icon
   - Select "Strategic Analysis"
   - Choose scenario type
   - Review recommendations

3. **Monitor Console**
   - Open Chrome DevTools
   - Filter for "[TLA BG]"
   - Watch for Elite AI responses

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (This Session if Time)
- [ ] Test with live game state
- [ ] Verify Vercel proxy with new system message format
- [ ] Check JSON parsing reliability

### Next Session Priority
1. **Context Learning Integration**
   - Wire up to Doug's context_tools
   - Store patterns after each session
   - Query before major decisions
   - Build opponent profiles

2. **HUD Display Enhancement**
   - Show recommendations with priority
   - Add confidence indicators
   - Display insights/warnings
   - Quick action buttons

3. **Real Game Testing**
   - Test all 5 decision types
   - Measure response quality
   - Tune prompts based on results
   - Gather elite player feedback

## KEY DECISIONS THIS SESSION

1. **System Message in AI Client**: Embedded directly for reliability
2. **Multiple Decision Types**: Different prompts for different situations
3. **Structured JSON Response**: Consistent format for parsing
4. **Context Persistence**: Store high-confidence insights
5. **Fallback Intelligence**: Smart defaults when AI unavailable

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Technical Success ✅
- AI client properly structured
- System messages include elite thinking
- Multiple decision prompts ready
- Background service integrated
- Test framework complete

### Strategic Success (To Verify)
- Recommendations surprise experienced players
- Insights go beyond obvious moves
- Considers psychological factors
- Adapts to server-specific patterns
- Provides contrarian strategies when optimal

## TROUBLESHOOTING

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| AI returns generic advice | Check system message is being sent |
| JSON parsing fails | AI client has fallback extraction |
| Proxy connection fails | Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in Vercel |
| No recommendations show | Check Chrome console for errors |

## SESSION SUMMARY

Successfully connected game state to AI client with elite system instructions and multiple decision prompts. Architecture allows for sophisticated strategic analysis beyond basic calculations. Ready for live testing with real game data.

The system now properly thinks like an elite player and can provide different types of analysis based on the game situation.
