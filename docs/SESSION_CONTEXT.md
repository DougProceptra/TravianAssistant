## üéØ CURRENT APPROACH: Firecrawl Data Scraping

### What We're Doing
**Scraping Kirilloid data with Firecrawl** - NOT using formulas (not reliable enough)
- Goal: Extract exact building data from kirilloid.ru
- Method: Use Firecrawl to programmatically scrape all building tables
- Status: Working on getting Firecrawl to handle JavaScript-rendered content

## ‚ùå FORMULAS REJECTED (Not Reliable Enough)

### Why Formulas Don't Work
- Only ~95% accurate - not good enough for competitive play
- T4 Extend inconsistencies make predictions impossible
- Too many edge cases and exceptions
- Can't handle special buildings correctly

### Validated But Not Using
```javascript
// These formulas work but aren't accurate enough:
cost = round5(baseCost * k^(level-1))
// We need 100% accuracy, not 95%
```

## üîß FIRECRAWL SCRAPING ATTEMPTS

### Current Challenge
Firecrawl can't properly render Kirilloid's JavaScript-heavy pages:
- Kirilloid uses URL fragments (`#b=21&s=2.46&mb=1`)
- Content loads entirely client-side via JavaScript
- Standard scraping returns empty tables

### What We've Tried
1. **Direct URL with fragments** - Returns default building (Workshop)
2. **executeJavascript action** - Tried to change window.location.hash
3. **Click and write actions** - Attempted dropdown manipulation
4. **Long wait times** - Gave JS time to load (5+ seconds)
5. **Browser console script** - Works manually but not via Firecrawl

### Browser Console Script Status
```javascript
// kirilloid-extractor.js - This WORKS in browser console
// But when run via Firecrawl, it finds no tables
// Problem: Firecrawl isn't rendering the page properly
```

Console output shows:
```
‚ùå No building data found on page
   Make sure you're on: http://travian.kirilloid.ru/build.php
```

## üìã NEXT STEPS

### Option 1: Fix Firecrawl Rendering
- Need to get Firecrawl to properly render JavaScript
- May need different scraping parameters
- Consider using `screenshot` format to debug what Firecrawl sees

### Option 2: Alternative Scraping Tools
- Playwright/Puppeteer might handle JS better
- Selenium as fallback option
- Custom headless browser solution

### Option 3: Manual Collection (Last Resort)
- Use browser console script manually
- Takes ~30 minutes to collect all buildings
- Creates complete JSON file
- 100% accurate but not automated

## üèóÔ∏è DATA REQUIREMENTS

### What We Need to Scrape
- All 30+ buildings from Kirilloid
- Levels 1-20 (or max level) for each
- Resources (wood, clay, iron, crop)
- Population, Culture Points, Build Time
- Prerequisites and special properties

### Building List to Scrape
```
Infrastructure: Main Building, Warehouse, Granary, Rally Point, Marketplace, Embassy
Military: Barracks, Stables, Workshop, Academy, Smithy, Tournament Square
Village: Cranny, Town Hall, Residence, Palace, Hero Mansion, Treasury, Trade Office
Resources: Woodcutter, Clay Pit, Iron Mine, Cropland
Boosters: Sawmill, Brickyard, Iron Foundry, Grain Mill, Bakery
Defense: City Wall, Earth Wall, Palisade, Stonemason, Great Barracks, Great Stable
Specials: Wonder of the World, Horse Drinking Trough, Great Warehouse, Great Granary
```

## ‚úÖ VERSION SYSTEM (Working)
- Version 1.0.0 current
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- Single source of truth (manifest.json)

## üö´ NOT DOING
- ‚ùå Using formulas (not accurate enough)
- ‚ùå Manual data entry (too time-consuming for production)
- ‚ùå Accepting 95% accuracy (need 100% for competitive edge)

**Session Status**: Attempting to scrape Kirilloid data with Firecrawl. Current blocker: Firecrawl not rendering JavaScript properly, returning empty tables. Need to either fix Firecrawl parameters or switch to alternative scraping solution.

**Critical Decision**: We are NOT using formulas - they're not reliable enough. We need exact data from Kirilloid for V4 to work properly.
