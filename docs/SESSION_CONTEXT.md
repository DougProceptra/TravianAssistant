*Last Updated: August 27, 2025, 20:58 PST*
*Session Status: CRITICAL - Build Broken, Previous Agent Failed to Follow Instructions*

## üî¥ FAILED SESSION - AGENT TERMINATED
### Why Previous Agent Was Fired
1. **Failed to read SESSION_CONTEXT.md thoroughly** - Skimmed instead of reading
2. **Ignored critical wrap-up from previous session** - Missed the entire section about v0.8.1 being broken
3. **Failed to verify state before acting** - Started making assumptions without running status check
4. **Wasted 2+ hours** - Referenced wrong versions (v0.7.11 instead of v0.8.1), gave incorrect advice
5. **Didn't follow explicit instructions** - Document clearly said to VERIFY state, agent ignored it

### What Previous Agent Missed (CRITICAL)
From the actual previous session wrap (which the agent failed to read):
- **ACTUAL VERSION**: v0.8.1 (NOT v0.7.11)
- **ACTUAL STATUS**: Build system BROKEN, chat NON-FUNCTIONAL
- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: index-fixed.ts imports WRONG file (conversational-ai.ts instead of conversational-ai-fixed.ts)
- **SIMPLE FIX NEEDED**: One line import change

## CURRENT STATUS: v0.8.1 - BUILD BROKEN, CHAT NON-FUNCTIONAL

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Problem Identified
**THE BUILD IS USING THE WRONG FILE**
- `index-fixed.ts` imports `'./conversational-ai'` (OLD broken version)
- Should import `'./conversational-ai-fixed'` (FIXED version with CSS fixes)
- This ONE LINE is why CSS doesn't work and chat breaks

### File Structure Reality
```
packages/extension/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conversational-ai.ts (OLD VERSION - BROKEN)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conversational-ai-fixed.ts (FIXED VERSION - NOT BEING USED)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts (old entry, not used)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index-fixed.ts (CURRENT ENTRY - IMPORTS WRONG FILE)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ background.ts (compiles but doesn't connect)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js (84KB - built from wrong source)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js (8KB - not connecting)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json (v0.8.1)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build-minimal.sh (current build script)
```

### Immediate Fix Required
```bash
cd ~/workspace/packages/extension

# 1. Fix the import in index-fixed.ts
sed -i "s|'./conversational-ai'|'./conversational-ai-fixed'|g" src/content/index-fixed.ts

# 2. Rebuild
./build-minimal.sh

# 3. Reload extension in Chrome
```

### Current Errors
- `content.js:2138 [TLA Chat] Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')`
- Background script: "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist"

## FILES THAT NEED FIXING
- `/packages/extension/src/content/index-fixed.ts` - Line 4: Change import from conversational-ai to conversational-ai-fixed

## BUILD SYSTEM
Current version: **v0.8.1** (BROKEN)
```bash
cd packages/extension
./build-minimal.sh  # Uses index-fixed.ts as entry point
```

## WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS
- Extension loads ‚úì
- Data collection works (8 villages parsed) ‚úì
- Chat UI appears ‚úì
- **NOTHING ELSE WORKS**

## GIT STATUS IN REPLIT
- Currently on commit 9944fbc (old)
- Many uncommitted changes in Replit
- GitHub not synced with Replit fixes

## CRITICAL FOR NEXT AGENT - READ THIS
1. **FIRST ACTION**: Ask Doug to run status check in Replit
2. **DO NOT ASSUME** anything about versions or state
3. **ONE FIX AT A TIME** - The import fix should solve CSS issue
4. **VERIFY EACH STEP** before proceeding
5. **The fix is simple** - One line import change, don't overcomplicate

## What Doug Needs (Simple)
1. Working chat that connects to AI
2. Text that doesn't overflow (CSS already exists in conversational-ai-fixed.ts)
3. Changes to actually build when modified
