## 🤖 AI INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### Backend Enhanced (server-enhanced.js)
```
Features Added:
├── /api/ai/chat - AI proxy endpoint for Claude
├── /api/game-state/:accountId - Real-time metrics
├── /api/settlement/update - Settlement tracking
├── Comprehensive game mechanics database
├── All 6 tribes with bonuses
├── Building CP calculations
├── Quest system data
└── AI conversation history
```

### HUD Connector (hud-connector.js)
```
Features:
├── Auto-sync every 30 seconds
├── Real-time game state scraping
├── AI chat interface in HUD
├── Settlement metrics display
├── Draggable interface
└── Backend connection status
```

### Key Metrics Displayed
- **Days to Settle** - Calculated estimate
- **Limiting Factor** - CP or Settlers
- **CP per Day** - Current production
- **Resource Balance** - Production optimization
- **Game Phase** - Foundation/Growth/Expansion/Settlement

---

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### AI Context System
The AI receives comprehensive game context:
- Current resources and production rates
- Building levels and CP generation
- Hero status and adventures
- Quest progress
- Settlement tracking
- Historical patterns from previous sessions

### Settlement Optimization Logic
- **CP Requirements**: 500 for village #2
- **CP Sources**: 
  - Embassy: 24 CP/day
  - Marketplace: 20 CP/day
  - Academy: 14 CP/day
  - Town Hall: 14 CP/day
  - Main Building: 5 CP/level
- **Egyptian Focus**: Waterworks +100% oasis bonus
- **Hero Strategy**: 40 resources per animal level in oasis

---

## 🔧 CURRENT CONFIGURATION

### Backend
- **URL**: https://workspace.dougdostal.repl.co
- **Port**: 3002
- **Database**: SQLite with WAL mode
- **AI Model**: Claude 3 Sonnet via Anthropic API

### Extension
- **Version**: 3.0.0
- **Manifest**: V3
- **Content Script**: Injected on *.travian.com/*.php*
- **Storage**: localStorage for config, Chrome storage for persistence

---

## 🚀 HOW TO USE

### Quick Start (In Replit)
```bash
# 1. Set environment variable
# Go to Secrets tab, add:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = sk-ant-...

# 2. Run deployment
bash deploy-ai.sh

# 3. Extension is ready in packages/extension/dist/
```

### Testing the AI
1. **Basic Questions**:
   - "When can I settle my next village?"
   - "What should I build next?"
   - "How can I optimize my resource production?"

2. **Strategic Questions**:
   - "Should I focus on CP or resources?"
   - "What's the best quest order?"
   - "How should I use my hero?"

3. **Tribe-Specific**:
   - "What's the Egyptian oasis strategy?"
   - "How do Romans benefit from simultaneous construction?"
   - "What are Teuton troop advantages?"

## 📊 DATA FLOW

```
Game Page → Scraper → HUD Connector → Backend → AI Proxy → Claude
    ↑                                      ↓
    └──────── AI Recommendations ←────────┘
```

1. **Scraper** extracts game state every 30s
2. **Connector** sends to backend with account ID
3. **Backend** enriches with game mechanics
4. **AI Proxy** adds context and queries Claude
5. **Response** displayed in HUD chat

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: AI Chat Says "Unavailable"
**Solution**: Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in Replit Secrets

### Issue: HUD Not Appearing
**Solution**: 
1. Check console for errors (F12)
2. Verify you're on a Travian page (*.travian.com/*.php)
3. Reload extension in Chrome

### Issue: Backend Connection Failed
**Solution**:
1. Verify backend is running: `node server-enhanced.js`
2. Check URL in localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('TLA_BACKEND_URL')`
3. For Replit: Ensure Webview is showing "Server Running"

### Issue: No Data Syncing
**Solution**:
1. Enter email when prompted (creates account ID)
2. Check Network tab for API calls
3. Verify backend database has tables: `/admin.html`

---

## 📝 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **AI Response Time**: ~2-3 seconds due to Claude API
2. **Sync Frequency**: 30 seconds (can be adjusted in code)
3. **Building Detection**: Best on dorf2.php (village view)
4. **CP Detection**: Requires culture points element visible
5. **Multi-Village**: Currently optimized for single village

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Settlement Race Strategy
1. **Days 0-2**: Foundation
   - All resources to level 1
   - Complete tutorial quests
   - Hero on adventures only

2. **Days 3-4**: Acceleration
   - One resource type to level 5
   - Build Main Building to 3
   - Start Marketplace

3. **Days 5-6**: CP Rush
   - Embassy → Academy → Town Hall
   - Complete building quests
   - NPC for balance

4. **Day 7**: Settlement
   - Train settlers (or chief)
   - Scout second village location
   - Settle with 750+ resources each

### Egyptian Optimization
- **Oasis Priority**: Clear with hero for 40 res/animal
- **Waterworks**: Build after day 3 for +100% bonus
- **Resource Focus**: Crop is less critical early
- **Building Order**: Embassy before Academy (more CP)
