## üü¢ CURRENT WORKING STATE (v0.9.5)

### What Actually Works
1. **Chat Interface** ‚úÖ
   - Draggable and resizable (THIS IS CRITICAL - DON'T BREAK IT)
   - Position persistence works
   - Chat loads and responds
   - Version 0.9.5 from commit a00eca9
   
2. **Village Detection** ‚úÖ
   - Overview parser correctly finds all 9 villages
   - Scrapes from dorf3.php successfully

### What's Broken
1. **Data Pipeline** ‚ùå
   - Overview parser finds 9 villages but content script sees 0
   - AI gets incomplete/wrong data (0 population, etc.)
   - Simple connection issue between parser and main script
   
2. **Version Management** ‚ùå
   - Version manager keeps resetting to 1.0.0
   - Need to manually fix after each build

## Critical Learning from Today's Failures

### What NOT to Do
1. **Don't create complex HUDs** - The AI agent IS the interface
2. **Don't break working UI** - v0.9.5 chat drag/resize MUST be preserved
3. **Don't add exports to content scripts** - Chrome doesn't support ES6 modules
4. **Don't trust version managers** - They override everything

### The Actual Goal
**AI AGENT FIRST** - Everything else is just plumbing to get data to the AI:
- Scrape game data ‚Üí Send to AI ‚Üí AI provides strategic advice
- The chat interface is the ONLY UI needed
- No HUDs, no data displays, no complex visualizations

## Fix Priority

### 1. Fix Data Connection (CRITICAL)
```javascript
// The bug is here - overview parser finds villages but they don't reach the AI
content.js:48 [TLA Overview] Successfully parsed 9 villages
content.js:2474 [TLA Content] Found 0 villages
```

### 2. Keep What Works
- DO NOT touch the chat UI code from v0.9.5
- DO NOT add new UI elements
- DO NOT change the drag/resize functionality

## Build Instructions That Actually Work

```bash
cd packages/extension

# For v0.9.5 (working UI, broken data):
git checkout a00eca9
./build-minimal.sh

# After any build:
sed -i 's/"version": "1.0.0"/"version": "0.9.5"/' dist/manifest.json
```

## Architecture Reality Check

```
Game Page ‚Üí Scrapers ‚Üí AI Agent ‚Üí Chat Response
              ‚Üë
              This is broken (returns 0 villages to AI)
```

The scrapers find data but don't pass it correctly to the AI.

## Documentation Status

### Deprecated/Misleading Docs
- ‚ùå `TRAVIAN_ASSISTANT_V3_COMPLETE.md` - Over-engineered, wrong approach
- ‚ùå `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` - Outdated, focuses on wrong things
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `TravianAssistantV4.md` - Needs update to reflect AI-first approach

### Current Reality Docs
- ‚úÖ `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` - This file (accurate current state)
- ‚úÖ `data-structures.md` - Still valid for game data format

## Next Developer Instructions

1. **Fix the data pipeline** without touching UI
2. **Test with v0.9.5** as baseline
3. **Keep the chat as primary interface**
4. **No HUDs or complex displays**

## What Success Looks Like

User: "What's my total production?"
AI: "Your 9 villages produce 45,000 resources per hour: 12k wood, 11k clay, 10k iron, 12k crop net."

NOT: A HUD showing numbers the user can already see in the game.
