# TravianAssistant Session Context

## ⚠️ PERMANENT PROJECT INFORMATION ⚠️
**Repository**: `dougproceptra/travianassistant` (GitHub)
- Owner: dougproceptra
- Repo: travianassistant
- Main branch: main

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: CODE DEVELOPMENT RULES ⚠️
**ALL CODE IS WRITTEN TO GITHUB - NEVER DUMP CODE IN SESSION**
- Code goes in GitHub repos, NOT in chat sessions
- Use git commits for all implementation work
- Workflow: GitHub → Pull to Replit → Deploy

*Last Updated: August 26, 2025, 17:30 PST*
*Session Status: INCOMPLETE - Version Management Issues*

## CURRENT STATUS: v0.7.0 Partially Fixed

### What Works
- ✅ 7 villages detected successfully
- ✅ Overview parser fetching from dorf3.php
- ✅ Safe scraper collecting data
- ✅ Chat UI renders and opens
- ✅ Email detection code (`isEmail`) now in build

### What's Broken
- ❌ Version numbers inconsistent across components
- ❌ Background service crash: `Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL`
- ❌ Chat fails with "Failed to get response"
- ❌ Email initialization flow not working end-to-end
- ❌ Multiple version numbers showing (0.5.1, 0.6.0, 0.6.4, 0.7.0)

## VERSION CHAOS SUMMARY

### Current Version Mismatches
- manifest.json: Shows 0.6.4 (should be 0.7.0)
- content.js: Shows "v0.5.1" in console
- background.js: Shows "v0.6.0" in console
- Package.json: Shows 0.6.0
- Build scripts: Auto-increment to 0.6.4

### Required Fix
ALL components must show v0.7.0 consistently:
1. manifest.json
2. package.json
3. Console logs in content.js
4. Console logs in background.js
5. Any UI elements showing version

## TECHNICAL ISSUES

### Build System Problem
Vite not properly including updated modules:
- vite.config.simple.ts only builds 4 entry points
- Doesn't follow imports properly
- conversational-ai.ts was not being included until manually added to imports

### Background Service Error (NEW)
```javascript
background.js:20 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL
    at l.initialize (background.js:20:97)
```
This crashes the background service, preventing chat from working.

### Email Detection Status
- Source file HAS the fix (conversational-ai.ts lines 28, 36)
- Build now INCLUDES it (grep shows 2 occurrences)
- But chat still fails due to background service crash

## FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION

1. `/packages/extension/src/content/overview-parser.ts` - Added getAllCachedVillages() method
2. `/packages/extension/src/content/conversational-ai.ts` - Added email detection and initialization
3. `/packages/extension/manifest.json` - Attempted v0.7.0 update (inconsistent)
4. `/packages/extension/src/content/index.ts` - Added import for conversational-ai

## BUILD PROCESS

### Working Build Command
```bash
cd ~/workspace/packages/extension
npx vite build --config vite.config.simple.ts
cp manifest.json dist/
cp public/*.html dist/ 2>/dev/null || true
cp public/*.css dist/ 2>/dev/null || true
cp public/*.png dist/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check if email fix is in build
grep -c "isEmail" dist/content.js  # Should return 2+

# Check versions
grep version dist/manifest.json
grep -o "v[0-9]\.[0-9]\.[0-9]" dist/content.js | head -1
grep -o "v[0-9]\.[0-9]\.[0-9]" dist/background.js | head -1
```

## ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING

### Data Flow
1. Game page loads → content.js initializes
2. Safe scraper fetches village data from dorf3.php
3. Chat button clicked → chat UI opens
4. User types message → should detect email format
5. If email: Send SET_USER_EMAIL to background
6. If not email: Send CHAT_MESSAGE to background
7. Background forwards to Vercel proxy
8. Vercel proxy calls Claude API
9. Response flows back through chain

### Current Failure Point
Background service crashes on initialization due to URL construction error, breaking entire message flow.

## NEXT SESSION REQUIREMENTS

### Must Fix
1. **Version Consistency**: All components must show v0.7.0
2. **Background URL Error**: Fix the URL construction crash
3. **End-to-End Test**: Email initialization → chat working
4. **Clean Build Process**: Consistent, repeatable builds

### Quality Standards
- Version numbers must be consistent across ALL files
- Console logs must show correct versions
- No "let's try this" debugging - research and fix properly
- Test each fix before claiming it works
- Document actual state, not theoretical state

## USER DETAILS
- Email: dostal.doug@gmail.com  
- Server: lusobr.x2.lusobrasileiro.travian.com
- Villages: 7 (names: 000-006)
- Rank: ~786
- Vercel Proxy: https://travian-proxy-simple.vercel.app/api/proxy (confirmed working)

## LESSONS LEARNED
- Version management was poorly handled
- Build system complexity not properly understood
- Changes claimed but not verified
- Testing inadequate before declaring success
