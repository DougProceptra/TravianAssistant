## Project: TravianAssistant V3
Browser-based AI assistant for Travian Legends gameplay optimization

## ✅ MAJOR MILESTONE: Complete Troop Data Extracted!

### What's Complete
1. **Building Calculation Engine** ✅
   - Build time formulas with modifiers
   - Resource costs and requirements
   - ROI calculations
   - Building data fully loaded

2. **Troop Data - ALL 9 TRIBES** ✅ 
   - Roman, Teutonic, Gallic - Complete with training times
   - Egyptian, Huns - Complete with training times
   - **Spartan** - Complete with training times
   - **Viking** - Complete with training times
   - Nature, Natarian - Complete (NPC only)
   - Training times in seconds at level 1
   - Consumption values corrected
   - Carry capacity fixed

3. **Hero Mechanics** ✅
   - Complete documentation in `/data/hero/hero-mechanics.md`
   - Tribal bonuses documented
   - Resource production formulas
   - Speed calculations

4. **Training Time Formula** ✅
   ```javascript
   Training Time = Base Time × 0.9^(Building Level - 1)
   // Each level reduces by 10%
   // Great Barracks/Stable: Additional 3× speed
   ```

### Next Critical Tasks (Before Launch)

#### 1. Integrate Troop Training into Calculator
```javascript
// calculation-engine/index.js needs:
function calculateTroopTraining(troopName, buildingLevel, isGreat = false) {
  const troop = getTroopData(troopName);
  let time = troop.training_time * Math.pow(0.9, buildingLevel - 1);
  if (isGreat) time = time / 3;
  return time;
}
```

#### 2. Create Game Start Optimizer
- Combine building + troop calculations
- Optimal settler timing (Day 7 target)
- Resource accumulation planning
- Quest path optimization

#### 3. Package for Team Use
- Simple HTML interface
- Build order generator
- Troop training scheduler
- Settlement location finder

## Files to Update

1. `/calculation-engine/index.js` - Add troop training calculations
2. `/calculation-engine/test.js` - Add troop training tests
3. Create `/implementation/game-start-optimizer.js`
4. Create `/implementation/settlement-calculator.js`

## Settlement Math (Egyptians)
- **3 Settlers Cost**: 9,000 wood, 15,120 clay, 19,530 iron, 14,490 crop
- **Training Time**: ~26.5 hours at Residence 10 (3 × 8.97 hours)
- **Target**: Day 6-7 settlement for top-5 finish

## Launch Readiness Checklist

- [x] Building calculations working
- [x] Troop data complete for all tribes
- [x] Hero mechanics documented
- [ ] Troop training integrated into calculator
- [ ] Game start optimizer built
- [ ] Settlement calculator ready
- [ ] Team testing guide created
- [ ] Chrome extension packaged

## Session Success Metrics

### Today's Wins
- ✅ Extracted Spartan and Viking troop data
- ✅ Fixed training times for all troops
- ✅ Corrected consumption values
- ✅ All 9 tribes now in database

### Remaining Work (Time Estimate: 2-3 hours)
1. **30 min**: Integrate troop calculations
2. **45 min**: Build game start optimizer
3. **30 min**: Create settlement calculator
4. **30 min**: Package and test
5. **30 min**: Documentation for team

## Quick Reference

### Egyptian Slave Militia (Cheapest Raid Unit)
- Cost: 15 wood, 45 clay, 60 iron, 30 crop
- Training: 900s (15 min) at Barracks 1
- Training: 322s (5.4 min) at Barracks 10
- Carry: 15 resources
- Speed: 7 fields/hour

### Roman Legionnaire (Balanced Early Unit)  
- Cost: 50 wood, 120 clay, 100 iron, 150 crop
- Training: 1600s (26.7 min) at Barracks 1
- Training: 573s (9.5 min) at Barracks 10
- Carry: 40 resources
- Speed: 6 fields/hour

### Settlement Timing Formula
```javascript
Total Time = Building Time + Resource Accumulation + Training Time
Building Time = Residence to 10 (~2 days with MB15)
Resource Time = Production Rate dependent (~2-3 days)
Training Time = 26.5 hours (can overlap with resource accumulation)
Total: 5-7 days for competitive settlement
```

## Final Push Priority

1. **MUST HAVE**: Working calculator with troop training
2. **SHOULD HAVE**: Automated build order generator
3. **NICE TO HAVE**: Chrome extension HUD
4. **CAN WAIT**: AI integration for recommendations
