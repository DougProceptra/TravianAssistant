## üö® DATA VALIDATION - RUN THIS BEFORE TRUSTING CALCULATIONS

### Validate All Building Data:
```bash
cd packages/extension
node validate.mjs
```

This will check:
- All building costs against Kirilloid values
- Missing buildings (we found Hero Mansion was missing!)
- Build time accuracy
- Formula calculations

**If validation fails**: Update `travian-constants.ts` with correct values

## üö® CRITICAL BUILD INSTRUCTIONS - USE THIS METHOD

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT USE VITE - IT'S BROKEN
Vite has persistent dependency issues with workspaces. Use our simple build instead.

### ‚úÖ CORRECT BUILD METHOD (30 seconds):
```bash
# From project root
cd packages/extension

# Check if dist/ already exists with files
ls -la dist/

# If dist/ has files, you're ready to load in Chrome!
# If not or to rebuild:
node build-simple.mjs

# Or if that fails, the dist/ from previous builds works
```

### üì¶ LOAD IN CHROME:
1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select `packages/extension/dist/` folder
5. Pin the extension to toolbar

## ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED

### Hero Mansion Issue Fixed:
- **Problem**: Hero Mansion base costs were missing
- **Solution**: Added correct base costs (700, 670, 700, 240)
- **Build times**: Added exact times from Kirilloid

### Data Validation System Created:
- `validate-data.ts` - Comprehensive validation
- `validate.mjs` - Runner script
- Checks ALL buildings against known accurate values

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN MISSING BUILDINGS

From validation, these buildings still need data:
- Rally Point
- Stables
- Workshop
- Blacksmith
- Armory
- Treasury
- Trade Office
- Cranny
- Great Warehouse
- Great Granary
- Stonemason
- Brewery
- Trapper
- Sawmill
- Brickyard
- Iron Foundry
- Grain Mill
- Bakery

**Impact**: Calculations for these buildings will fail until data is added

## üéÆ YOUR SERVERS

| Server | Speed | When | Setting |
|--------|-------|------|---------|
| Current | 2x | Now | Default in extension |
| Annual Special | 1x | Sept 9 | Use preset button |

## üìä VALIDATED FORMULAS

These are confirmed accurate:
- ‚úÖ Hero Mansion costs (all levels)
- ‚úÖ Main Building costs
- ‚úÖ Barracks costs
- ‚úÖ Marketplace costs
- ‚úÖ Resource field costs (Woodcutter, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Build times with server speed

## üîß IF BUILD ISSUES OCCUR

The `dist/` folder already contains a working build. If you have issues:

1. **Option 1**: Use existing dist/ folder (already built)
2. **Option 2**: Run `node build-simple.mjs`
3. **Option 3**: Copy files manually:
   ```bash
   cp manifest.json dist/
   cp public/* dist/
   cp -r src/options dist/
   ```

## üí° TESTING YOUR FORMULAS

1. Load extension in Chrome
2. Click extension icon ‚Üí Options
3. Configure server (2x for current)
4. Click "Test Formulas" button
5. Check console for calculation results

## üìù NEXT STEPS

1. **Run validation**: `node validate.mjs`
2. **Add missing building data** from Kirilloid
3. **Re-validate** after adding data
4. **Test with real queries** in game

**Version**: 1.0.1
**Build Method**: build-simple.mjs (NOT Vite)
**Status**: PARTIALLY VALIDATED - Some buildings missing
**Your dist/ folder**: Already has working files!
