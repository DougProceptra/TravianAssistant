# TravianAssistant Session Context
*Last Updated: August 30, 2025, 6:35 PM EST*

## CURRENT_FOCUS
Preparing for Sept 1 beta test on new 1x Travian server. Focus on completing data extraction from Kirilloid and implementing game start optimization features.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK

### Kirilloid Data Extraction - PARTIAL SUCCESS
**Python Solution That Worked:**
- Python requests successfully fetches Kirilloid HTML (64,425 chars)
- Found and extracted buildings array from line 732
- Successfully parsed 47+ buildings with costs and multipliers
- Calculated all level costs using formula: `round5(baseCost * k^(level-1))`

**Data Successfully Extracted:**
```javascript
// Complete building data including:
- Building names and IDs (gid)
- Base costs (Level 1) for wood, clay, iron, crop
- Multiplier values (k) for cost calculations
- Maximum levels for each building
- Basic upkeep and culture values
```

### Files Created
- `buildings_array.js` - Raw JavaScript from Kirilloid
- `kirilloid_buildings.json` - Clean JSON with base values
- `kirilloid_complete.json` - Full data with all levels calculated

## üîß CURRENT ARCHITECTURE

### Backend Structure
- **Database**: SQLite3 with schema in `backend/travian-schema-v2.sql`
- **Server**: Node.js backend in `backend/server-sqlite.js`
- **Proxy**: Vercel edge functions for Anthropic API (working)
- **Data Import**: Various scripts in `/scripts/` for Kirilloid extraction

### Chrome Extension
- **Manifest V3**: Working content script and service worker
- **HUD Overlay**: Basic implementation ready
- **API Integration**: Via Vercel proxy (CORS resolved)
- **Storage**: Chrome Storage API + IndexedDB for 7 days history

## ‚ö†Ô∏è STILL NEEDED FOR SEPT 1 BETA

### Critical Data Missing
1. **Build Time Calculations**
   - Have formula reference `TimeT3` but need to decode
   - Main Building acceleration effect calculation
   
2. **Game Mechanics**
   - Culture point accumulation rates
   - Resource field production formulas
   - Hero level progression and bonuses
   - Daily quest/task reward system

3. **Troop Data**
   - Training costs and times
   - Attack/defense statistics
   - Movement speeds and carry capacity

### Implementation Tasks
1. **Complete Kirilloid extraction** (1 day remaining)
2. **Import data to SQLite database**
3. **Connect extension to backend**
4. **Implement AI recommendations engine**
5. **Test with live game data**

## üö´ WHAT DIDN'T WORK

### Firecrawl Issues
- **Completely blocked by Kirilloid** (404 errors)
- All configurations failed (mobile, actions, etc.)
- Root cause: Kirilloid blocks Firecrawl's IP range
- **Solution**: Python requests from Replit works perfectly

## üìù KEY DECISIONS

### Data Strategy (Aug 30, 2025)
- **Use existing extracted building data** for V4
- **Priority**: Resource costs are 100% accurate (sufficient for beta)
- **Defer**: Additional fields can be added post-beta
- **Rationale**: Ship faster with core functionality

### Architecture Decisions
- **V4 Spec is authoritative** (not V3)
- **SQLite for data storage** (not Supabase initially)
- **Vercel for API proxy** (resolved CORS issues)
- **Research mode for Firecrawl recon** (if it works)

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### For Sept 1 Beta (Priority Order)
1. **Run Firecrawl reconnaissance** (30 min test)
   - Use prepared prompt to discover all available data
   - If blocked, expand Python scraper
   
2. **Extract remaining critical data**
   - Build times with Main Building effect
   - Culture points and settler requirements
   - Resource production formulas
   
3. **Database population**
   - Import all game constants to SQLite
   - Create API endpoints for data access
   
4. **Extension integration**
   - Connect to backend API
   - Implement basic recommendations
   - Test with live game

## üí° INSIGHTS & PATTERNS

### Technical Learnings
- **Simple beats complex**: Python requests > Firecrawl for Kirilloid
- **JavaScript embedded in HTML**: Data is in page source, not separate files
- **Replit IPs not blocked**: Unlike Firecrawl's infrastructure

### Project Patterns
- Heavy experimentation phase with 40+ scripts
- Multiple approaches attempted (Firecrawl, Puppeteer, Python)
- Good documentation practices maintained throughout

## ‚ùì OPEN QUESTIONS & CONCERNS

### Critical Questions for Next Session

1. **Beta Timeline Concern**
   - Sept 1 is tomorrow - is this still realistic given remaining work?
   - Should we focus on MVP features only?

2. **Data Files Location**
   - `kirilloid_buildings.json` and `kirilloid_complete.json` not in repo
   - Are these stored locally only? Should they be committed?

3. **Extension Status**
   - The extension code exists but seems incomplete
   - Is the HUD overlay actually working or just scaffolded?

4. **Backend Server Confusion**
   - Multiple server files: `server.js`, `server-sqlite.js`, `server-sqlite-fixed.js`
   - Which one is the production version?

5. **Missing Integration**
   - Don't see where extension connects to backend API
   - Is this not implemented yet?

6. **Server Speed Handling**
   - Need equations to convert between 1x/2x/3x speeds or separate data sets?

7. **Version Support**
   - Focus on T4 only or also support T4.6?

8. **Data Completeness**
   - Is 80% data extraction acceptable for beta?

## üöÄ RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BETA SUCCESS

### Minimum Viable Beta (if time is tight)
- Use only the building data already extracted
- Hardcode some game constants temporarily
- Focus on ONE feature that works end-to-end
- Test with existing server before Sept 1 if possible

### Data Priority
- If Firecrawl fails, immediately pivot to Python scraper expansion
- Build times are critical - consider hardcoding formula if extraction fails
- Culture points can be approximated initially

### Code Organization Needs
- **Scripts folder cleanup**: 40+ files need organization
  - Consider subfolders: `/scripts/fixes/`, `/scripts/scrapers/`, `/scripts/tests/`
- **Clarify which server file is production**
- **Document or implement extension-backend connection**

### Testing Strategy
- Have backup plan if new server has unexpected changes
- Consider testing with current server first
- Prepare fallback constants if data extraction incomplete

## üîÑ VERSION CONTROL

### Current State
- **Main branch**: Contains working extension + backend
- **Last commit**: Updated SESSION_CONTEXT.md
- **Vercel deployment**: Proxy working at travian-assistant-proxy.vercel.app

### Repository Health
- Multiple experimental scripts (can be cleaned up post-beta)
- Good separation of concerns (backend, extension, scripts)
- Documentation up to date with this SESSION_CONTEXT

---

**Session Status**: Prepared Firecrawl reconnaissance prompt. Multiple concerns about beta readiness raised. Need to address critical questions and potentially reduce scope for Sept 1 deadline.

**Critical Path**: Data extraction ‚Üí Database population ‚Üí Extension integration ‚Üí Beta test

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - Significant work remaining with <24 hours to beta. Consider MVP approach.
