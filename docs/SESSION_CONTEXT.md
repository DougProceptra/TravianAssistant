## Project: TravianAssistant V3
Browser-based AI assistant for Travian Legends gameplay optimization

## Mission Statement
Transform Travian gameplay from tedious spreadsheet calculations to AI-powered strategic excellence, enabling top-20 competitive play in under 2 hours per day.

## Critical Accomplishments - Session August 30, 2025

### Data Extraction Complete ✅
Successfully extracted ALL game data from Kirilloid's Travian calculator (http://travian.kirilloid.ru):

#### Buildings Data (50 buildings total)
- **2x Server**: `travian_complete_buildings_data.json` - All 50 buildings including specials
- **1x Server**: `travian_buildings_SS1X.json` - Complete 1x server building costs/times

Each building includes for all levels (1-20, WW has 100):
- Resource costs (wood, clay, iron, crop)
- Population requirements  
- Build time (base time before speed modifiers)
- Culture points generated

Buildings extracted include:
- Resource fields (Woodcutter, Clay Pit, Iron Mine, Cropland)
- Resource processors (Sawmill, Brickyard, Iron Foundry, Grain Mill, Bakery)
- Infrastructure (Warehouse, Granary, Great Warehouse, Great Granary)
- Military (Barracks, Stable, Workshop, Academy, Smithy, Tournament Square)
- Defensive (City Wall, Earth Wall, Palisade, Stone Wall, Makeshift Wall)
- Special (Palace, Residence, Treasury, Wonder of the World, etc.)

#### Troops Data (8 tribes)
- **2x Server**: `travian_all_tribes_complete.json` - 7 tribes
- **2x Server Spartans**: `travian_spartans_troops.json` - Spartan troops separate
- **1x Server**: `travian_troops_SS1X.json` - All 8 tribes including Spartans

Tribes captured:
1. Romans (10 troops)
2. Teutons (10 troops)  
3. Gauls (10 troops)
4. Egyptians (10 troops)
5. Huns (10 troops)
6. Spartans (10 troops)
7. Nature (10 troops - for oasis animals)
8. Natarians (10 troops - for end-game)

Each troop type includes:
- Attack value
- Defense vs infantry
- Defense vs cavalry
- Movement speed (fields/hour)
- Training costs (wood, clay, iron, crop)
- Training time (base before modifiers)
- Carry capacity
- Crop consumption per hour

### Technical Achievements
1. **Overcame Kirilloid's non-standard navigation** - Site uses JavaScript-based navigation, not standard links
2. **Direct data extraction from JavaScript arrays** - Found and extracted from `window.buildings` array
3. **Automated tribe rotation** - Script automatically cycled through all tribes
4. **Dual server speed support** - Captured both 1x and 2x server data for comparison

### Key Code Solutions
- Building extraction: Direct access to `buildings.getStat()` function
- Troop extraction: Automated dropdown cycling with event dispatching
- Data structure: Consistent JSON format for easy integration

## Next Session Focus: Game Mechanics & Multipliers

### Priority 1: Combat Mechanics
- [ ] **Hero System**
  - Weapon bonuses (attack increase per point)
  - Armor bonuses (defense increase per point)
  - Horse bonuses (speed increase)
  - Fighting strength calculation
- [ ] **Smithy Upgrades**
  - Attack improvements (1.5% per level, max level 20)
  - Defense improvements (1.5% per level, max level 20)
- [ ] **Wall Bonuses**
  - Defensive multipliers by tribe and wall type
  - Durability points and their effect
- [ ] **Morale Bonus**
  - Protection for smaller players

### Priority 2: Production Modifiers
- [ ] **Oasis Bonuses**
  - 25% single resource oases
  - 50% double resource oases (25% + 25%)
  - Crop oases (25% or 50%)
- [ ] **Gold/Silver Membership**
  - 25% production bonus calculation
  - 25% faster building/training
- [ ] **Hero Resource Production**
  - Points in resource production
  - Items that boost production
- [ ] **Artifacts**
  - Small/Large/Unique effects
  - Building time reduction
  - Troop training speed

### Priority 3: Advanced Calculations
- [ ] **Culture Point System**
  - Settlement timing optimization
  - Daily CP production calculations
  - Celebration costs and benefits
- [ ] **Trade Routes**
  - Merchant capacity by tribe
  - Travel time calculations
  - NPC trading ratios
- [ ] **Farm Lists**
  - Efficiency calculations
  - Loss tolerance settings
  - Optimal raid intervals

### Priority 4: AI Integration Design
- [ ] **Build Order Optimization**
  - Resource balance algorithms
  - CP rush vs military strategies
  - Gold usage optimization
- [ ] **Combat Simulators**
  - Battle outcome predictions
  - Optimal troop compositions
  - Artifact effects on combat
- [ ] **Timing Optimizations**
  - Queue management
  - Resource arrival coordination
  - Building/training completion alerts

## Technical Stack (Confirmed)
- **Frontend**: Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
- **Backend**: Node.js on Replit
- **Database**: SQLite (dev) → Supabase (production)
- **AI**: Claude Sonnet 4 via Anthropic API
- **Data Source**: Game scraping + Kirilloid calculator data

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Complete game data extraction
- ⬜ Multiplier system implementation
- ⬜ Chrome extension alpha
- ⬜ AI recommendation engine
- ⬜ Beta testing with team (Target: September 9)
- ⬜ <2 hours/day gameplay achievement

## Notes for Next Session
1. Focus on implementing multiplier calculations first
2. Build simple test harness to verify calculations match game
3. Start with Smithy upgrades as they're most straightforward (1.5% per level)
4. Hero system is complex - may need separate deep dive
5. Consider building calculator UI for testing before Chrome extension
