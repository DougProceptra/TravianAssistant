*Server Launch: September 1, 2025 (TOMORROW)*

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS: Extension Working, Needs Data Access Fix

### What's Working ✅
1. **Chrome Extension v1.0.4** - Loaded and running
2. **Chat Interface** - Visible, draggable, resizable, persistent position
3. **AI Integration** - Responds via Vercel proxy (Claude working)
4. **Village Detection** - Sees all 9 villages (000-008)
5. **Database Storage** - IndexedDB storing account snapshots
6. **Backend Server** - Running on Replit port 3000
7. **Game Data** - All troops/buildings/hero data loaded

### What's Broken ❌
1. **Resource Scraping** - Not getting actual resource values
2. **Building Detection** - Not reading current buildings
3. **Troop Counts** - Not accessing troop information
4. **Current Page Context** - Not detecting which building/page user is on

### Server Details
- **URL**: lusobr.x2.lusobrasileiro.travian.com
- **Speed**: 2x server
- **Tribe**: Egyptians (with multi-tribe villages - T4.6 feature)
- **Villages**: 9 total

## Architecture (Confirmed Working)

```
Chrome Extension (v1.0.4)
    ├── Content Script (scrapes game)
    ├── Background Service (coordinates)
    └── Chat UI (user interface)
           ↓
    Vercel Proxy (CORS handler)
           ↓
    Claude AI (Anthropic)
           ↓
    Response displayed in chat
    
Parallel:
    Replit Backend (port 3000)
    ├── Game mechanics data
    ├── Troop/building stats
    └── Database storage
```

## Critical Next Steps

### 1. Fix Resource Scraping
The extension sees villages but not their details. Need to fix selectors for:
- Resource amounts (wood/clay/iron/crop)
- Production rates
- Building levels
- Current construction queue

### 2. Add Server Configuration
Need options page to set:
- Current server URL
- Server speed (1x, 2x, 3x, etc.)
- Primary tribe

### 3. Connect Backend Data
Extension should query Replit backend for:
- Building costs/times
- Troop training calculations
- Game mechanics formulas

### 4. Memory/Context Service
Plan to add:
- Conversation persistence
- Learning from corrections
- Pattern recognition
- Strategy memory

## Console Evidence
```
[TLA Chat] Initializing conversational AI v1.0.4...
[TLA Overview] Successfully parsed 9 villages
[TLA DB] Account snapshot stored with 9 villages
[TLA Chat] Chat interface initialized v1.0.4
[TLA Content] Periodic scrape: {accountId: 'account_lusobr_x2_lusobrasileiro_travian_com', ...}
```

## Session Accomplishments
1. ✅ Got backend server running with database
2. ✅ Fixed build system (version 1.0.4)
3. ✅ Extension loaded and chat working
4. ✅ AI responding through Vercel proxy
5. ✅ Villages detected (9 total)
6. ⚠️ Resource scraping needs fixing

## For Next Session
1. Fix resource/building/troop scraping
2. Add server configuration in options
3. Connect to backend for game calculations
4. Test full flow with real game data
5. Add memory/context persistence

*Extension is 90% working. Just needs data scraping fixes to provide full game context to AI.*
