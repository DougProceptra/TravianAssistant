# TravianAssistant Session Context

## ⚠️ PERMANENT PROJECT INFORMATION ⚠️
**Repository**: `dougproceptra/travianassistant` (GitHub)
- Always use this repository location
- Owner: dougproceptra
- Repo: travianassistant
- Main branch: main

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: CODE DEVELOPMENT RULES ⚠️
**ALL CODE IS WRITTEN TO GITHUB - NEVER DUMP CODE IN SESSION**
- Code goes in GitHub repos, NOT in chat sessions
- Use git commits for all implementation work
- Session is for discussion, decisions, and architecture
- Small script snippets for Replit execution are OK
- Full implementations must go directly to GitHub files
- Workflow: GitHub → Pull to Replit → Deploy

## MAJOR PIVOT: FROM CALCULATOR TO ELITE AI ASSISTANT

### What We Built vs What We Need
**Original Plan**: Travian calculator with AI suggestions
**Reality Check**: Doug has 15 years experience - doesn't need basic calculations
**New Direction**: Elite AI strategist providing non-obvious competitive advantages

## TODAY'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Aug 26)

### Phase 1: Data Extraction ✅
- Cloned Kirilloid repository
- Extracted game constants (buildings, costs, CP values)
- Created `travian-constants.ts` with core mechanics
- Built basic settlement calculator

### Phase 2: Realization & Pivot ✅
**Key Insight**: Calculators are rigid. Travian is dynamic. Elite players need adaptive AI, not formulas.

Issues with pure calculator approach:
- Can't adapt when attacked
- Ignores psychological factors
- Misses political dynamics
- No learning from experience
- Treats all servers identically

### Phase 3: Elite AI Architecture ✅
Created three critical components:

1. **Elite System Instructions** (`elite-player-instructions.md`)
   - Thinks like top-20 player, not helper
   - Considers psychology, timing, server politics
   - Focuses on non-obvious insights
   - Challenges conventional wisdom

2. **Strategic Decision Prompts** (`elite-decision-prompts.md`)
   - Daily strategic reviews
   - Attack/defense analysis
   - Diplomacy with game theory
   - Win condition assessment
   - Innovation opportunities

3. **Context Management** (`context-manager.ts`)
   - Integrates with Doug's context_tools
   - Stores patterns after sessions
   - Queries before major decisions
   - Learns from outcomes
   - Builds opponent profiles

## THE REAL ARCHITECTURE

```
Game State → AI Analysis (with Context) → Strategic Insights
                    ↑                           ↓
            Historical Patterns          Learn & Store
```

Not: "Build Main Building level 5 by hour 72"
But: "Building at 3am reveals sleep schedule. Consider deception pattern."

## FILES CREATED TODAY

### Data/Calculator Phase
- `/scripts/analyze-kirilloid.sh`
- `/scripts/extract-game-data.sh`
- `/scripts/extract-settlement-data.sh`
- `/packages/extension/src/game-data/travian-constants.ts`
- `/packages/extension/src/calculators/settlement-calculator.ts`
- `/packages/extension/src/calculators/settlement-calculator-v2.ts`

### Elite AI Phase
- `/packages/extension/src/ai/elite-player-instructions.md` ⭐
- `/packages/extension/src/ai/elite-decision-prompts.md` ⭐
- `/packages/extension/src/ai/context-manager.ts` ⭐

### Documentation
- `/docs/KIRILLOID_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`
- `/docs/AI_SETTLEMENT_LOGIC.md`

## CRITICAL INSIGHTS GAINED

1. **Data Extraction Incomplete**: 
   - Missing Vikings, Spartans tribes
   - Only got T5, not T3/T4 variants
   - No troop data, hero mechanics, adventures
   - BUT: Have enough for beta testing

2. **Architecture Must Be AI-First**:
   - Calculators = rigid, predictable
   - AI = adaptive, learns, surprises opponents
   - Context is everything in competitive play

3. **Doug Needs Elite Insights, Not Basics**:
   - Skip "how to build a warehouse"
   - Focus on "why enemies think you're weak"
   - Provide counter-intuitive strategies

## READY FOR TESTING

### What Works Now
✅ Game constants available for reference
✅ Elite AI instructions ready
✅ Decision prompts for critical moments
✅ Context management framework
✅ Extension collecting game state

### Testing Priority
1. **Connect game state to AI prompts**
2. **Send to Claude via Vercel proxy**
3. **Display strategic insights in HUD**
4. **Start storing patterns with context_tools**

### What to Test First
- Daily strategic review with current game state
- Settlement location decision (beyond simple distance)
- Response to being scouted
- Resource crisis resolution

## IMMEDIATE NEXT SESSION TASKS

### Technical Integration
```bash
# Pull latest code
cd ~/workspace
git pull origin main

# Test AI prompt generation
node test-ai-prompts.js

# Connect to Vercel endpoint
curl -X POST https://travian-proxy-simple.vercel.app/api/anthropic \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "[game state] + [elite prompt]"}'
```

### First Test Scenario
1. Export current game state from extension
2. Apply "Daily Strategic Review" prompt
3. Send to Claude with elite instructions
4. Evaluate quality of insights
5. Store patterns that emerge

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Not Success
❌ Calculating building costs accurately
❌ Predicting settlement to the hour
❌ Following optimal build order

### Real Success
✅ Identifying non-obvious opportunities
✅ Predicting opponent behavior
✅ Winning through superior strategy
✅ Achieving more with less time investment

## KEY DECISIONS DOCUMENTED

1. **Pivot from Calculator to AI**: Calculators exist. Elite AI doesn't.
2. **Context Over Constants**: Patterns matter more than formulas
3. **Psychology Over Math**: Human behavior drives Travian
4. **Learn and Adapt**: Each server is unique

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI gives generic advice | Elite system instructions enforce competitive thinking |
| Missing game data | Use AI to reason about unknowns |
| Context gets stale | Continuous learning via context_tools |
| Too complex for beta | Start with daily review, expand from there |

## HANDOFF READY

Everything committed to GitHub. Architecture defined. Ready for integration testing.

The system now thinks like an elite player, not a calculator.

*Session complete. Architecture pivoted from calculator to elite AI assistant. Ready for testing.*
