- **Settler training optimization** - Critical for 7-day goal

#### 2. HERO MECHANICS (Critical for Early Game)
- **Hero resource production** - How much bonus per point
- **Hero adventure rewards** - Expected value calculations
- **Hero fighting strength** - Impact on early raids
- **Hero item management** - Which items to keep/use
- **Hero experience optimization** - Adventure vs combat
- **Skill point allocation** - Resource vs strength early game

#### 3. EARLY GAME SPECIFICS
- **Quest optimization path** - Which quests when
- **Adventure timing** - When to send hero
- **First raid timing** - When to build troops vs economy
- **Robber hideout strategies** - Clear or ignore?
- **Oasis capture timing** - When is it worth it?
- **Resource field vs building priorities** - Exact breakpoints

#### 4. TRIBE-SPECIFIC CALCULATIONS
- **Egyptian waterworks** - When to build, impact
- **Roman double build queue** - How to optimize
- **Teuton raiding bonus** - Changes early strategy
- **Gaul defensive benefits** - Impact on troop choices
- **Hun command center** - Settlement strategy changes

## SESSION 3 TO-DO LIST (Next 36 Hours)

### Immediate Priority (Next 4 hours)
1. **Integrate troop calculations into engine**
   - Training time formulas with barracks/stable levels
   - Exact resource costs from loaded data
   - Upkeep calculations affecting economy

2. **Add hero system**
   - Resource production bonus formula
   - Fighting strength calculations
   - Adventure probability tables
   - Experience requirements per level

3. **Calculate settler timing precisely**
   - Residence build requirements
   - Resource accumulation needed (5000/7000/5000/4000)
   - Training time with modifiers
   - Optimal timing for top-5 finish

### Before Launch (Next 32 hours)
1. **Test complete 7-day simulation**
   - Hour-by-hour build order
   - Resource balance checkpoints
   - CP accumulation tracking
   - Settler readiness confirmation

2. **Create quick reference guide**
   - First 24 hours exact steps
   - Gold spending priorities
   - Hero point allocation
   - Raid timing guidelines

3. **Package for easy use**
   - Simple HTML interface if no extension
   - Copy-paste build orders
   - Calculator for current state input

## Key Questions to Resolve

### Troop Questions
1. What's the exact formula for troop training time?
2. How do barracks/stable levels affect training speed?
3. What's the Great Barracks/Stable speed bonus?
4. How does hero helmet affect training time?

### Hero Questions
1. Resource production: Is it 4 resources/hour per point at 1x?
2. Fighting strength: What's the combat formula?
3. Adventure rewards: What's the probability distribution?
4. When should hero switch from adventures to raiding?

### Early Game Decisions
1. First troop: When? (Usually day 2-3)
2. Raid vs pure economy: Breakpoint calculation
3. Oasis: 25% bonus worth the troops?
4. Second village location: How far is optimal?

## Data Still Needed

### From Kirilloid or Game Knowledge
1. **Hero formulas** - Production, strength, experience
2. **Training speed formulas** - Per building level
3. **Combat formulas** - For early raids
4. **Quest rewards** - Exact values for planning
5. **Adventure rewards** - Probability tables

### From Game Experience
1. **Optimal opening moves** per tribe
2. **Gold spending priorities** for top-5
3. **Hero skill distribution** for fast start
4. **Raid timing** for server start

## Current File Structure
```
/calculation-engine/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js           [ðŸ”¶ Needs troop/hero integration]
â””â”€â”€ test.js            [ðŸ”¶ Needs troop/hero tests]

/data/
â”œâ”€â”€ buildings/         [âœ… Complete]
â”œâ”€â”€ troops/           [âœ… Loaded, ðŸ”´ Not integrated]
â”œâ”€â”€ production/       [ðŸ”´ Need base formulas]
â”œâ”€â”€ combat/           [ðŸ”´ Need hero/combat formulas]
â”œâ”€â”€ quests/           [ðŸ”´ Need quest data]
â””â”€â”€ tribe-specific/   [ðŸ”´ Need bonus values]
```

## Server Launch Countdown

### September 1, 2025 - Launch Day
- **Time Remaining**: ~36 hours
- **Critical Path**: Troop calculations â†’ Hero mechanics â†’ Full test
- **Minimum Viable**: Building optimizer + manual troop timing
- **Goal**: Complete system with troop/hero optimization

### If We Run Out of Time
**Fallback Plan**: 
- Use building optimizer for economy
- Manual calculations for troops/hero
- Reference sheet for key timings
- Update system during first week

## Session Notes

### Current Blockers
1. Don't have troop training formulas
2. Don't have hero mechanics formulas  
3. Haven't integrated troop data yet
4. Need to test complete 7-day simulation

### What's Working
- Building calculations are accurate
- Data structure is solid
- Architecture is extensible
- Core optimizer logic is sound

### Next 4 Hours Focus
1. Research/extract troop training formulas
2. Integrate troop data into calculator
3. Add hero mechanics
4. Test settler timing calculations
