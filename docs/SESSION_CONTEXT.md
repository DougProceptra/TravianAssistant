*Last Updated: August 27, 2025, 16:30 PST*
*Session Status: Chat Working But Needs UI/Persistence Fixes*

## CURRENT STATUS: v0.7.11 - Chat Functional with Issues

### ✅ What Was Fixed This Session
1. **getAllCachedVillages error**: FIXED - Was using `.size` on array, changed to `.length`
2. **Chat not responding**: FIXED - Changed `.get()` on `.find()` in ai-chat-client.ts line 161
3. **Data collection**: WORKING - Successfully parsing all 8 villages
4. **Chat connection**: WORKING - Connects to Vercel proxy and gets AI responses

### ⚠️ Current Issues (Not Yet Fixed)
1. **Chat UI text overflow**: Responses run off the edge of chat window - needs CSS word-wrap
2. **Chat state loss**: Loses conversation when page auto-refreshes - needs chrome.storage persistence  
3. **Email re-entry**: Have to re-enter email after page refresh
4. **"Found 0 villages"**: Shows 0 at initialization even though 8 villages are parsed
5. **Response formatting**: AI responses need better formatting for readability

## FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION
- `/packages/extension/src/content/index-fixed.ts` - Line 18: Changed villages.size to villages.length
- `/packages/extension/src/ai/ai-chat-client.ts` - Line 161: Changed .get() to .find() for array compatibility

## BUILD SYSTEM
Current version: **v0.7.11**
```bash
cd packages/extension
./build-simple.sh  # Auto-increments version, uses rollup then falls back to esbuild
```

## WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING NOW
- Extension loads on Travian pages ✓
- Parses all 8 villages correctly ✓  
- Chat UI appears and accepts input ✓
- Sends messages to AI and gets responses ✓
- Background service is running ✓

## PRIORITY FIXES FOR NEXT SESSION

### 1. Fix Chat UI CSS (5 min fix)
Add to `.tla-chat-message` class in conversational-ai.ts:
```css
word-wrap: break-word;
overflow-wrap: break-word;
max-width: 100%;
```

### 2. Add Chat Persistence (30 min fix)
- Store chat history in chrome.storage.local
- Store email in chrome.storage.sync  
- Restore on page load
- Key code location: src/content/conversational-ai.ts

### 3. Fix "Found 0 villages" message
- The villages array is empty at init time
- Either remove the log or delay it until after first fetch
- Location: src/content/index-fixed.ts line 18

## TESTING NOTES
- Server: lusobr.x2.lusobrasileiro.travian.com
- User has 8 villages (000-007)
- Chat shows v0.7.11 in header
- Using Vercel proxy at travian-proxy-simple.vercel.app

## GIT STATUS IN REPLIT
- Currently on commit 9944fbc (before any V3 changes were pulled)
- All fixes made directly in Replit, not yet pushed to GitHub
- No V3 infrastructure changes were pulled down

## CRITICAL FOR NEXT AGENT
1. **DO NOT** add complex backend infrastructure - focus on fixing existing issues
2. **TEST** each fix individually before moving to next
3. **VERIFY** GitHub repo is DougProceptra/TravianAssistant before any operations
4. Chat IS working but needs UI and persistence fixes
5. Data collection IS working - don't break it

*Session accomplished: Fixed critical chat functionality bugs. Chat now connects and responds but needs UI/persistence improvements.*
