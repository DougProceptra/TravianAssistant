## üö® CRITICAL BUILD INSTRUCTIONS - USE THIS METHOD

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT USE VITE - IT'S BROKEN
Vite has persistent dependency issues with workspaces. Use our simple build instead.

### ‚úÖ CORRECT BUILD METHOD (30 seconds):
```bash
# From project root
cd packages/extension

# Check if dist/ already exists with files
ls -la dist/

# If dist/ has files, you're ready to load in Chrome!
# If not or to rebuild:
node build-simple.mjs

# Or if that fails, the dist/ from previous builds works
```

### üì¶ LOAD IN CHROME:
1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select `packages/extension/dist/` folder
5. Pin the extension to toolbar

## ‚úÖ BETA RELEASE COMPLETE - v1.0.0

### What's Ready:
1. **Complete Formula System** ‚úÖ
   - All Kirilloid calculations implemented
   - Server speed support (2x current, 1x for Sept 9)
   - Tested with comprehensive test suite

2. **Extension Options** ‚úÖ
   - Server configuration UI
   - Speed presets (2x, 1x, 5x)
   - Formula testing built-in

3. **Game Data** ‚úÖ
   - Building costs, troop stats
   - Production formulas
   - Travel time calculations

## üéÆ YOUR SERVERS

| Server | Speed | When | Setting |
|--------|-------|------|---------|
| Current | 2x | Now | Default in extension |
| Annual Special | 1x | Sept 9 | Use preset button |

## üìä FORMULA CAPABILITIES

Your extension can now answer ANY Travian calculation:
- Building costs (any level range)
- Resource accumulation time
- Troop training costs and time
- Travel time between coordinates
- Settlement costs per village
- Warehouse/granary capacity
- Production with oasis bonuses
- Raid efficiency calculations
- Culture point generation
- And much more...

## üîß IF BUILD ISSUES OCCUR

The `dist/` folder already contains a working build. If you have issues:

1. **Option 1**: Use existing dist/ folder (already built)
2. **Option 2**: Run `node build-simple.mjs`
3. **Option 3**: Copy files manually:
   ```bash
   cp manifest.json dist/
   cp public/* dist/
   cp -r src/options dist/
   ```

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

- Vite doesn't work with npm workspaces (use build-simple.mjs instead)
- Options page needs manual API key entry (no UI validation yet)

## üí° TESTING YOUR FORMULAS

1. Load extension in Chrome
2. Click extension icon ‚Üí Options
3. Configure server (2x for current)
4. Click "Test Formulas" button
5. Check console for calculation results

## üìù FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

Not needed for beta, but planned:
- Connect formulas to AI responses
- Auto-detect server speed
- Real-time game state scraping
- Alliance coordination tools
