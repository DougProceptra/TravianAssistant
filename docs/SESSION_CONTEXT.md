# TravianAssistant Session Context

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: CODE DEVELOPMENT RULES ‚ö†Ô∏è
**ALL CODE IS WRITTEN TO GITHUB - NEVER DUMP CODE IN SESSION**
- Code goes in GitHub repos, NOT in chat sessions
- Use git commits for all implementation work
- Session is for discussion, decisions, and architecture
- Small script snippets for Replit execution are OK
- Full implementations must go directly to GitHub files
- Workflow: GitHub ‚Üí Pull to Replit ‚Üí Deploy

## ACCOMPLISHED TODAY ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ Fixed overview parser - now detects all 7 villages
2. ‚úÖ Created master data collector system
3. ‚úÖ Built settlement advisor AI component
4. ‚úÖ Extension successfully collecting village data

## CURRENT STATUS
- **Extension Working**: Detecting 7 villages, storing in IndexedDB
- **Data Collection**: Overview parser fetching from `/dorf3.php`
- **AI Components**: Settlement advisor created, needs integration
- **Next Step**: Connect AI to extension UI for recommendations

## KEY FINDINGS
- Overview page uses `table#overview` with 7 rows
- Villages stored in IndexedDB (accountSnapshots, villageSnapshots)
- Extension v0.5.1 running in safe mode (no navigation)
- Resources detected correctly from current page

## FILES CREATED/UPDATED
- ‚úÖ `/packages/extension/src/collectors/master-collector.ts`
- ‚úÖ `/packages/extension/src/content/overview-parser.ts` (fixed)
- ‚úÖ `/packages/extension/src/ai/settlement-advisor.ts`
- ‚úÖ `/docs/DATA_DOMAIN_SPEC.md`

## IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS
1. Create Claude API client wrapper
2. Build UI component for displaying recommendations
3. Test settlement advisor with real game data
4. Package extension for beta distribution

## TESTING COMMANDS
```bash
# Pull latest and build
cd ~/workspace
git pull origin main
cd packages/extension
npm install
npm run build

# Extension is in: packages/extension/dist/
```

## BETA TIMELINE
- **Aug 26 (Today)**: ‚úÖ Data collection working
- **Aug 27**: UI integration + Claude connection
- **Aug 28**: Testing with team
- **Aug 29**: Beta release

## SUCCESS METRICS
- Target: 4-8 hours faster settlement
- Current capability: Can analyze game state
- Next: Need AI recommendations displayed

## NOTES
- Extension already deployed and working in Doug's browser
- Need to expose settlement advisor to UI
- Consider adding manual "Get Settlement Advice" button
- Must connect to Claude via Vercel proxy
