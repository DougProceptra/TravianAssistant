# TravianAssistant Session Context

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY READING INSTRUCTION ‚ö†Ô∏è
**You must read every word of this document. You must read it 3 times. The first as a senior architect guiding the work of an application. The second time is as a developer that will be executing the steps and directions emanating from document and the third time as business analyst making sure you understand the functions and processes being addressed and how they affect the game. You cannot proceed until you fully comprehend every aspect of the SESSION_CONTEXT.md document.**

## üõë MANDATORY STOP GATES - DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT THESE

### BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGE:
- [ ] Run `grep [function] dist/background.js` - VERIFY what's actually there
- [ ] Run `node -c dist/background.js` - CHECK for syntax errors
- [ ] State: "The EXACT error I'm fixing is: _____" (no fix without error)
- [ ] State: "I verified this error exists by: _____" (no assumption)

### IF YOU CANNOT CHECK ALL BOXES, STOP.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED: NO MORE SED COMMANDS
**Session Learning**: Multiple sed commands corrupted the code and broke the chat multiple times. 
**MANDATE**: For UI changes, manually edit files or use precise, tested replacements. NO BLIND SED.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: CORRECT GITHUB REPOSITORY ‚ö†Ô∏è
**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/DougProceptra/TravianAssistant
- Owner: **DougProceptra** (NOT dougyb83, NOT DougZackowski)  
- Repository: **TravianAssistant**
- Main branch: **main**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REPLIT WORKSPACE ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Replit URL**: https://replit.com/@dougdostal/TravianAssistant
- Workspace path: `~/workspace`
- Extension path: `~/workspace/packages/extension`
- Build output: `~/workspace/packages/extension/dist`

*Last Updated: August 28, 2025, 01:30 PST*
*Session Status: CORE WORKING - UI Polish Needed*

## ‚úÖ WORKING VERSION: v0.9.5 - CORE FUNCTIONALITY ACHIEVED

### What Works (CRITICAL SUCCESS)
1. **‚úÖ Chat connects to Claude Sonnet 4** - PRIMARY GOAL ACHIEVED
2. **‚úÖ Profile indicator shows initialization status**
3. **‚úÖ Messages scroll properly**
4. **‚úÖ Chat opens and closes**
5. **‚úÖ Can send messages and receive AI responses**
6. **‚úÖ Version management system working**

### What Doesn't Work (UI Polish - Non-Critical)
1. **‚ùå Chat window not draggable** - Code inserted but not connected properly
2. **‚ùå Resize handle not visible** - resize: both is set but handle hard to see
3. **‚ùå Text doesn't wrap in input** - wrap="soft" attribute not applying

### Current Status
- Extension version: **v0.9.5**
- API Proxy: **https://travian-proxy-simple.vercel.app/api/proxy** ‚úì WORKING
- Model: **claude-sonnet-4-20250514** ‚úì WORKING
- Build: `./build-minimal.sh` ‚úì WORKING

## ATTEMPTED FIXES THAT FAILED

### Dragging Implementation
- Variables `isDragging`, `dragStartX`, etc. were added but scope issues
- Event listeners added to header but not firing
- Problem: Variables declared both globally and locally, causing conflicts
- Solution for next session: Create single `makeDraggable()` method with all logic contained

### Text Wrapping
- Tried: `wrap="soft"` attribute
- Tried: `style="word-wrap: break-word"`
- Problem: Attributes not being applied or overridden by CSS
- Solution for next session: Add inline style directly in template string

### Resize Handle
- CSS `resize: both` is applied
- Problem: Default browser handle is tiny and hard to see
- Solution for next session: Add custom visual indicator (‚Üò icon in corner)

## FILES TO FIX IN NEXT SESSION

### src/content/conversational-ai-fixed.ts
This file needs MANUAL editing (no sed!):

1. **Fix dragging**: Add complete method at end of class:
```typescript
private makeDraggable(): void {
  const header = this.chatInterface?.querySelector('.tla-chat-header');
  if (!header) return;
  
  let active = false;
  let currentX = 0;
  let currentY = 0;
  let initialX = 0;
  let initialY = 0;
  
  header.addEventListener('mousedown', dragStart);
  // ... complete implementation
}
```

2. **Fix text wrap**: In the template string:
```html
<textarea id="tla-chat-input" 
          wrap="soft" 
          style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
```

3. **Fix resize indicator**: Add visual element:
```css
.resize-indicator {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  content: "‚Üò";
  padding: 2px;
}
```

## VERSION MANAGEMENT (WORKING)
Three places must stay in sync:
1. `build-minimal.sh` - VERSION="0.9.5"
2. `src/version.ts` - VERSION = '0.9.5'
3. `manifest.json` - "version": "0.9.5"

## CRITICAL FOR NEXT SESSION

### DO NOT:
- Use multiple sed commands in sequence
- Try to insert complex JavaScript with sed
- Make assumptions about line numbers or formatting

### DO:
- Manually edit conversational-ai-fixed.ts in Replit editor
- Test each change individually
- Commit working versions immediately
- Focus on Doug's priority: **Making the chat UI usable for aggressive testing**

## PROJECT CONTEXT
Doug needs the chat UI fully functional because it's the primary way to test what data the agent sees and how it interprets game state. The chat must be:
- Moveable (draggable) to see game elements underneath
- Resizable to show more conversation history
- Have wrapping text for long queries

## GIT STATUS
- Repository synced
- Last commit pushed successfully
- Clean working directory

*Session wrap: Core functionality achieved. UI polish needs manual code editing, not sed commands.*
