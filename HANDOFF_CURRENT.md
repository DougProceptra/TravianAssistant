# TravianAssistant - Development Handoff Document

## Current Status (Updated)
- ✅ Completed truncated Smart HUD implementation
- ✅ Added AI provider flexibility (Claude Sonnet default, easily switchable)
- ✅ Created comprehensive type definitions
- ✅ All code committed directly to Git repository
- ✅ Ready for Replit pull and testing

## Quick Setup Instructions for Replit

### 1. Pull Latest Changes from GitHub
```bash
# In your Replit Shell
cd ~/TravianAssistant

# Fetch and checkout the feature branch
git fetch origin
git checkout feat/complete-mvp-implementation

# Or if you want to merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin feat/complete-mvp-implementation
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Or if using pnpm (as indicated by pnpm-lock.yaml)
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure API Key in Replit
Make sure your Anthropic API key is in Replit Secrets:
- Key: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Value: Your API key (sk-ant-...)

### 4. Build the Extension
```bash
# Navigate to extension package
cd packages/extension

# Build the extension
npm run build

# This creates a 'dist' folder with the built extension
```

### 5. Load Extension in Chrome
1. Download the `dist` folder from Replit
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the downloaded `dist` folder

## Files Created/Updated in This Session

### New Files Created
1. **packages/extension/src/content/smart-hud.ts**
   - Complete HUD implementation with all features
   - Drag and drop, minimize, chat interface
   - Full styling and animations

2. **packages/extension/src/background/claude-service.ts**
   - AI provider abstraction
   - Support for multiple AI providers
   - Claude Sonnet as default
   - 30-second caching

3. **packages/extension/src/lib/types.ts** (Updated)
   - Comprehensive type definitions
   - Game state, player profile, analysis types
   - Message types for Chrome extension
   - Backward compatibility maintained

4. **HANDOFF_CURRENT.md** (This file)
   - Updated documentation
   - Setup instructions
   - Testing checklist

## Testing on Your Server

Server URL: https://lusobr.x2.lusobrasileiro.travian.com/

### Test Checklist
- [ ] Extension loads without errors
- [ ] HUD appears on Travian pages
- [ ] HUD can be dragged around the screen
- [ ] HUD can be minimized/maximized
- [ ] Refresh button triggers analysis
- [ ] Chat interface accepts questions
- [ ] Position is saved between page loads

### Console Commands for Testing
```javascript
// Check if extension loaded
console.log('Extension loaded:', typeof chrome.runtime !== 'undefined');

// Test message passing
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'ANALYZE_NOW' }, response => {
  console.log('Analysis response:', response);
});

// Check stored data
chrome.storage.local.get(null, items => {
  console.log('Stored data:', items);
});
```

## AI Model Configuration

Currently configured for Claude Sonnet (`claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`).

### To Change Models
Edit `packages/extension/src/background/claude-service.ts`:
```typescript
// Line 15 - Change default model
constructor(apiKey: string, model: string = 'claude-3-haiku-20240307') {
```

Available models:
- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` - Best quality (current)
- `claude-3-haiku-20240307` - Cheaper, faster
- `claude-3-opus-20240229` - Most capable but expensive

## Next Steps Priority

### Immediate (Today)
1. Pull changes to Replit
2. Build and test extension
3. Verify HUD appears on Travian
4. Test Claude API integration

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Implement state collector for your server
2. Test with real game data
3. Adjust selectors if needed
4. Share with friends for testing

### Medium-term (Next Week)
1. Add usage tracking
2. Implement action execution
3. Create profile import/export
4. Add error recovery

## Known Issues & TODOs

### Must Fix
- [ ] State collector selectors may need adjustment for your server
- [ ] Add icon files (currently missing)
- [ ] Implement action execution (currently just logs)

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Usage tracking and cost management
- [ ] Alliance coordination features
- [ ] Mobile companion app
- [ ] Web dashboard

## Cost Management

With Claude Sonnet:
- ~$0.003 per 1K input tokens
- ~$0.015 per 1K output tokens
- Average analysis: ~2K tokens = ~$0.02
- With 30-second caching: ~40 analyses/day = $0.80/day
- Monthly: ~$24/month split 4 ways = $6/person

Consider Haiku for production (10x cheaper).

## Git Workflow

### Current Branch Structure
```
main
└── feat/complete-mvp-implementation (current)
```

### To Merge to Main
```bash
# After testing
git checkout main
git merge feat/complete-mvp-implementation
git push origin main

# Tag release
git tag v1.0.0-mvp
git push origin v1.0.0-mvp
```

## Support & Debugging

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| HUD not appearing | Check console for errors, verify URL matches |
| API errors | Check API key in storage/secrets |
| Build fails | Run `npm install` first |
| Types errors | Make sure all imports use `/lib/types` |

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check build output
ls -la packages/extension/dist/

# Watch for changes during development
cd packages/extension
npm run dev

# Check TypeScript errors
npm run type-check
```

## Architecture Summary

```
Travian Page → Content Script → Background Service → Claude API
                    ↓                    ↓              ↓
                Smart HUD ← Recommendations ← AI Analysis
```

### Key Components
1. **Smart HUD** - User interface overlay
2. **State Collector** - Scrapes game data
3. **Claude Service** - AI provider abstraction
4. **Background Service** - Message broker
5. **Profile Manager** - User preferences

## Important Notes for Next Session

1. **All code is in Git** - No need to copy/paste
2. **Feature branch created** - `feat/complete-mvp-implementation`
3. **Ready for testing** - Just pull, build, and load
4. **Handoff friendly** - Comprehensive documentation included

---

**Remember to commit this to memory**: This project uses a monorepo structure with the Chrome extension in `packages/extension/`. All implementation code has been written directly to the Git repository on the `feat/complete-mvp-implementation` branch. The main focus is on practical, working solutions that can be shared with friends quickly.
