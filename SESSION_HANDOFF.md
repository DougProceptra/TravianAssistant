# Travian AI Assistant - Session Handoff Document

## Project Context
This is Doug's Travian AI Assistant Chrome extension project for the browser game Travian Legends. Doug is a solopreneur at Proceptra who works at the architect level, using Claude heavily for implementation. This project aims to create an AI-powered assistant that provides intelligent game recommendations using Claude API.

## Previous Session Work Summary

### Session 1: Architecture Design
We developed three key architectural documents (already in the repo):
1. **Travian Multi-Agent AI System Architecture.md** - Original complex agent-based design
2. **Quick Implementation: AI Agent System in 14 Days.md** - Simplified approach using Claude as the brain
3. **TravianAssistant Web App Architecture & Implementation Plan.md** - Full SaaS platform design

### Session 2: Complete Implementation
We created a full Chrome extension implementation with 10 comprehensive documentation files in the `implementation/` folder:

1. **01-complete-implementation-overview.md** - Project structure and setup
2. **02-core-types.md** - TypeScript interfaces for game state, profiles, analysis
3. **03-state-collector.md** - Web scraping logic for Travian game pages
4. **04-claude-service.md** - Claude API integration with prompting strategy
5. **05-smart-hud.md** - Draggable overlay UI (incomplete - cut off mid-file)
6. **06-background-service.md** - Chrome extension background service worker
7. **07-profile-manager.md** - Player profile management system
8. **08-content-script.md** - Main content script initialization
9. **09-options-page.md** - React-based settings page
10. **10-configuration-files.md** - Package.json, manifest.json, vite config, etc.

## Key Implementation Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Chrome Extension Manifest V3** - Modern extension architecture
- **TypeScript** - Type safety for complex game state
- **React** - For options page only (HUD is vanilla JS for performance)
- **Vite** - Build tool for fast development
- **Claude Haiku API** - Cheapest Claude model for cost-effectiveness
- **Chrome Storage API** - For profiles and settings

### Architecture
```
[Travian Game Page] → [Content Script] → [Background Service Worker] → [Claude API]
                           ↓                      ↓                        ↓
                      [Smart HUD] ← [Recommendations] ← [AI Analysis]
```

### Core Features Implemented
1. **Automatic game state collection** via DOM scraping
2. **Intelligent Claude prompting** with player profile context
3. **Customizable player profiles** (tribe, style, goals, weights)
4. **Smart HUD overlay** with recommendations and chat
5. **Profile import/export** for sharing with friends
6. **30-second response caching** to minimize API costs
7. **Natural language Q&A** about game strategy

## CRITICAL: Replit Integration

⚠️ **Doug has a Replit project for this** - The previous session missed this crucial detail.

### Replit Project Structure Needed
```
travian-ai-assistant/
├── src/
│   ├── background/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── options/
│   └── shared/
├── public/
│   └── icons/
├── manifest.json
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── vite.config.ts
└── .env
```

### Steps to Set Up in Replit

1. **Create the directory structure:**
```bash
# In Replit shell
mkdir -p src/{background,content,options,shared}
mkdir -p public/icons
```

2. **Extract code from implementation docs:**
Each markdown file in `implementation/` contains complete code. You need to:
- Copy code from `02-core-types.md` → `src/shared/types.ts`
- Copy code from `03-state-collector.md` → `src/content/state-collector.ts`
- Copy code from `04-claude-service.md` → `src/background/claude-service.ts`
- Copy code from `05-smart-hud.md` → `src/content/smart-hud.ts`
- Copy code from `06-background-service.md` → `src/background/index.ts`
- Copy code from `07-profile-manager.md` → `src/background/profile-manager.ts`
- Copy code from `08-content-script.md` → `src/content/index.ts`
- Copy code from `09-options-page.md` → `src/options/index.tsx` and `src/options/index.html`
- Copy configs from `10-configuration-files.md` → root directory files

3. **Install dependencies in Replit:**
```bash
npm init -y
npm install react react-dom
npm install -D @types/chrome @types/react @types/react-dom @vitejs/plugin-react typescript vite
```

4. **Configure Replit secrets:**
- Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Replit Secrets (not .env file)
- Access in code via `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

5. **Modify for Replit environment:**
Replit might need adjustments for:
- Build output path (Replit serves from specific directories)
- Hot reload configuration
- Port settings for development

### Replit-Specific Considerations

1. **Build Command**: Add to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "replit-build": "vite build --outDir=dist --emptyOutDir",
    "dev": "vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000"
  }
}
```

2. **Replit Config** (`.replit` file):
```toml
run = "npm run replit-build"
entrypoint = "manifest.json"

[packager]
language = "nodejs"

[packager.features]
packageSearch = true
guessImports = true
```

3. **Extension Testing in Replit**:
- Build the extension: `npm run replit-build`
- Download the `dist` folder as ZIP
- Extract locally and load as unpacked extension in Chrome

## Known Issues to Address

1. **File 05-smart-hud.md is incomplete** - The code was cut off mid-function. Need to complete:
   - The `showAnswer()` method
   - The `hide()` method  
   - Position saving/loading functions

2. **Missing icon files** - Need to create or obtain icon files:
   - `icons/icon16.png`
   - `icons/icon48.png`
   - `icons/icon128.png`

3. **API Key Security** - Current implementation stores key in Chrome storage. Consider:
   - Environment variables for development
   - Secure key management for production

4. **Cost Management** - Implement usage tracking and limits:
   - Daily/monthly quotas
   - Per-user limits
   - Cost alerts

## Next Session Priority Tasks

### Immediate (Session 3)
1. ✅ Complete the truncated `smart-hud.ts` code
2. ✅ Set up the Replit project with proper structure
3. ✅ Test basic functionality with a mock game state
4. ✅ Verify Claude API integration works

### Short-term (Session 4-5)
1. Add missing features:
   - Execute action functionality (currently just logs)
   - Real-time attack notifications
   - Alliance coordination features
2. Improve scraping reliability for different Travian versions
3. Add error recovery and retry logic
4. Create icon designs

### Medium-term (Session 6+)
1. Implement the web dashboard from the SaaS architecture doc
2. Add team/alliance features
3. Set up payment processing for shared API costs
4. Create mobile companion app

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Extension loads in Chrome
- [ ] HUD appears on Travian game pages
- [ ] Game state collection works (check console)
- [ ] Claude API returns recommendations
- [ ] Profile creation/editing works
- [ ] Import/export profile codes work
- [ ] Chat questions get responses
- [ ] HUD can be dragged and minimized

### Test URLs
- Main game: `https://ts30.x3.international.travian.com/`
- Village view: Test on resource fields, building, reports
- Check state collection on different pages

## Important Context for Next Session

1. **Doug's Working Style**: 
   - Architect-level, not deep implementation
   - Prefers leveraging existing tools
   - Values practical, working solutions over perfection

2. **Project Goals**:
   - Working MVP quickly (originally 14-day timeline)
   - Share with 3 friends to split API costs
   - Adaptable to different play styles via profiles

3. **Technical Decisions**:
   - Using Claude as the brain (not hard-coded strategies)
   - Chrome extension for easy distribution
   - React only for options page (performance consideration)

4. **Cost Model**:
   - ~$0.01-0.02 per analysis with Claude Haiku
   - ~$30 total for 3-month game server
   - Split among 4 friends = ~$7.50 each

## Questions for Doug (Next Session)

1. **Replit Project URL**: What's the Replit project URL for direct collaboration?
2. **Testing Server**: Which Travian server are you testing on?
3. **Timeline**: Still targeting 14-day implementation?
4. **Friends**: Are your 3 friends ready to test? What play styles?
5. **Priorities**: Focus on Chrome extension or also start web dashboard?

## Session Success Metrics

The next session should accomplish:
1. ✅ Get working code into Replit
2. ✅ Complete any truncated code sections
3. ✅ Test extension on actual Travian game
4. ✅ Verify Claude API integration works with real game state
5. ✅ Package extension for Doug's friends to test

**Note to Next Session**: Doug has all the code in markdown docs but needs it properly structured in his Replit project. Focus on practical implementation over perfect code - Doug values working solutions he can share with friends quickly.
