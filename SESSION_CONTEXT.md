## 🎯 Current Focus
**Status**: Fixed village detection, implementing overview scraper
**Version**: 0.4.8
**Priority**: Use game's village overview popup instead of navigation

## 📊 Latest Changes

### Fixed ✅
1. **Village Detection**: Changed `#sidebarBoxVillagelist` to `#sidebarBoxVillageList` (capital L)
2. **Endless Loop**: Removed automatic village navigation
3. **Manual Collection**: Added explicit user-triggered collection

### New Approach 🎯
Instead of navigating between villages (problematic), we'll use the game's built-in Village Overview popup:
- **Eye icon** opens overview with all villages
- **Resources tab**: Shows all resources/production
- **Troops tab**: Shows all troops  
- **Culture tab**: Shows culture points
- No navigation needed = no interference with gameplay!

## 🔧 Implementation Status

### What's Working
- Village detection finds all 6 villages
- Manual collection button (doesn't auto-navigate)
- Backend sync to SQLite
- Claude AI integration

### What Needs Work
1. **Integrate overview scraper** with main extension
2. **Add button** to open overview and collect data
3. **Update HUD** to show aggregated stats
4. **Test** with all 6 villages

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Update enhanced-scraper.ts** to use overview scraper
2. **Add "Collect from Overview" button** to HUD
3. **Test collection** from overview popup
4. **Update display** with all village data

## 💡 Key Learning

The game provides a perfect data source in the Village Overview popup:
- All villages in one place
- No need to navigate
- Complete resource/troop/building data
- Won't interfere with gameplay
- Likely compliant with game rules

## 🚀 Build Instructions

```bash
cd packages/extension
pnpm build
```

Then reload extension in Chrome.

*Key Insight: Use the game's own UI elements (overview popup) rather than trying to automate navigation*
