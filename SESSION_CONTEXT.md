*Last Updated: August 21, 2025 - 3:00 PM PST*

## 🎯 Current Status
**Version**: 0.4.9
**Safety**: FIXED - No more dangerous auto-navigation
**Villages**: Correctly detects all 6 villages

## 🔒 CRITICAL SAFETY FIXES (Just Implemented)

### What Was Wrong
- Extension was auto-navigating between villages
- Could interrupt critical game operations (attacks, builds, etc.)
- Full scan was looping endlessly through villages
- Version showing as 0.4.2 instead of 0.4.9 (old code running)

### What's Fixed ✅
1. **NO Automatic Navigation** - Completely removed
2. **Double Confirmation** for Full Scan - Warns about interruption
3. **Smart State** - Uses cached data, no navigation needed
4. **Safe Auto-Refresh** - Every 15 minutes, current village only

## 📊 Feature Status

### Working ✅
- **Village Detection**: All 6 villages found correctly
- **Quick Analyze**: Safe, uses cached data for other villages
- **AI Integration**: Claude Sonnet 4 analysis working
- **Chat Interface**: Questions and responses display properly
- **Data Persistence**: IndexedDB storing village history
- **15-minute Refresh**: Only current village (safe)

### Needs Testing 🧪
- **Full Scan**: Now has double confirmation - test carefully
- **Cached Data**: Should show data from previous scans
- **AI Recommendations**: Should parse and display better
- **Chat Responses**: Should show in chat window

## 🛡️ Safety Modes

### Quick Analyze (SAFE)
- Only scrapes current village
- Uses cached data for other villages
- No navigation required
- Can run anytime

### Full Scan (DANGEROUS)
- Requires TWO confirmations
- Will navigate through all villages
- Returns to starting village when done
- DO NOT run during critical operations

### Auto-Refresh (SAFE)
- Every 15 minutes
- Current village only
- No navigation

## 🐛 Known Issues
1. Console shows version 0.4.2 - need to rebuild and reload
2. Going to rally point during scan (should be fixed now)

## 📝 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Pull latest code: `git pull origin main`
- [ ] Rebuild: `cd packages/extension && pnpm build`
- [ ] Reload extension in Chrome
- [ ] Verify version shows 0.4.9 in HUD
- [ ] Test Quick Analyze - should be instant and safe
- [ ] Test Full Scan - should show TWO warnings
- [ ] Check auto-refresh isn't navigating villages
- [ ] Test AI analysis display
- [ ] Test chat responses showing

## 🔧 Debug Commands

In browser console:
```javascript
// Check version
window.TLA.version

// Check current state
window.TLA.debug()

// Get village list
window.TLA.navigator.getVillages()

// Check background service
await window.TLA.testBg()
```

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Navigation is Dangerous** - Can interrupt game operations
2. **Caching is Essential** - Avoid navigation by using cached data
3. **User Control Required** - Never auto-navigate without permission
4. **Game's Overview Better** - Should use village overview popup instead

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test Safety Fixes** - Ensure no unwanted navigation
2. **Implement Overview Scraper** - Use game's built-in popup
3. **Improve Caching** - Better historical data usage
4. **Add Settings** - Let users control refresh intervals

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

- **NEVER** auto-navigate without explicit permission
- **ALWAYS** warn before full scan
- **TEST** during non-critical game moments
- **REBUILD** extension after pulling changes
