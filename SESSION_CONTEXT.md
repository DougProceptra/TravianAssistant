# TravianAssistant Session Context
*Last Updated: August 21, 2025 - Evening*

## ‚úÖ WORKING COMPONENTS

### Vercel Proxy - FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- **URL**: `https://travian-proxy-simple.vercel.app/api/proxy`
- **Status**: Working correctly, no changes needed
- **Model**: Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- **Note**: This proxy is stable and functional - DO NOT CHANGE

## üéØ Current Priority
**FOCUS**: Stabilize HUD/Scanner, then integrate Resource Bar approach
**Version Issue**: Still showing 0.4.2 (needs rebuild)
**Key Discovery**: Resource Bar extension gets all village data WITHOUT navigation!

## üî¥ Critical Issues

### 1. Version Mismatch
- **Problem**: Console shows v0.4.2 instead of v0.4.9
- **Impact**: Old code running, fixes not applied
- **Solution**: Need to rebuild: `cd packages/extension && pnpm build`

### 2. Full Scan Incomplete
- **Behavior**: Scanned village 000, moved to 001, then stopped
- **Expected**: Should scan all 6 villages
- **Status**: Investigating why it stops after second village

### 3. Background Service Disconnecting
```
Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.
```
- **Impact**: AI features not working
- **Solution**: Need to reload extension properly

## üí° Resource Bar Discovery

The Resource Bar extension successfully:
- Shows **total production** from ALL villages: `216W + 210Y + 210V + 100 Air`
- Shows **time to storage full**: `15:36:34`
- Gets data from all 6 villages **WITHOUT navigation**
- Updates in real-time

### Possible Techniques Resource Bar Uses:
1. **Game API/AJAX interception** - Catching village data from game's own calls
2. **Network request monitoring** - Intercepting HTTP responses
3. **Village overview parsing** - Using game's built-in overview feature
4. **Local storage/cookies** - Reading game's stored data

## üìã Next Session Action Plan

### Phase 1: Stabilize Current Build
1. **Fix version issue**
   ```bash
   cd packages/extension
   pnpm build
   # Reload in Chrome
   ```

2. **Verify basic functions**
   - [ ] HUD shows v0.4.9
   - [ ] Quick Analyze works (current village only)
   - [ ] 6 villages detected correctly
   - [ ] No auto-navigation occurring

3. **Verify proxy connection**
   - [ ] Check service worker registration
   - [ ] Test connection to Claude proxy (already working)
   - [ ] Verify API responses

### Phase 2: Analyze Resource Bar Code
1. **Extract key components**
   - How it gets village data
   - Network interception methods
   - Data aggregation approach

2. **Identify game endpoints**
   - Village data API calls
   - Update frequencies
   - Authentication/session handling

3. **Document the approach**
   - Create implementation plan
   - List required changes
   - Estimate effort

### Phase 3: Implement Safe Data Collection
1. **Replace navigation-based scanning**
   - Use Resource Bar's technique
   - No village switching needed
   - Real-time updates

2. **Update HUD display**
   - Show total production like Resource Bar
   - Add storage overflow timers
   - Display all villages summary

## üêõ Known Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Version shows 0.4.2 | HIGH | Need rebuild |
| Full scan stops at village 2 | MEDIUM | Investigating |
| Background service disconnects | HIGH | Need reload |
| Auto-navigation risk | CRITICAL | Partially fixed |

## üìä Current Stats
- **Villages Detected**: 6 ‚úÖ
- **Villages in HUD**: 6 ‚úÖ  
- **Quick Analyze**: Working (cached data)
- **Full Scan**: Broken (stops early)
- **AI Analysis**: Working when background service connected
- **Chat**: Working when background service connected
- **Vercel Proxy**: FULLY FUNCTIONAL ‚úÖ

## üîß Debug Info

Current village IDs:
- 000: 24488
- 001: 20985
- 002: 21104
- 003: 21214
- 004: 27828
- 005: 20522

Console commands for debugging:
```javascript
// Check version (should be 0.4.9)
window.TLA.version

// Get village list
window.TLA.navigator.getVillages()

// Test background service
await window.TLA.testBg()

// Get current state
window.TLA.debug()
```

## üéØ Success Criteria for Next Session

1. **Stable HUD** - Version 0.4.9, no crashes
2. **Safe scanning** - No unwanted navigation
3. **Resource Bar analysis** - Understand their approach
4. **Implementation plan** - Clear path to safe data collection

## üí° Key Insight

**Resource Bar proves it's possible to get all village data without navigation.**
This is the breakthrough we need - we've been approaching the problem wrong.
Instead of navigating to each village, we should intercept the game's own data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT FORGET

1. **REBUILD the extension** before testing anything
2. **Resource Bar code is priority** - it has the solution
3. **No auto-navigation** - safety first
4. **Document everything** - for future sessions
5. **Vercel proxy is working** - don't change it
