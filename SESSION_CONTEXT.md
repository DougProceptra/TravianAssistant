# TravianAssistant Session Context
**Last Updated**: August 27, 2025 - 8:30 PM
**Repository**: https://github.com/DougProceptra/TravianAssistant
**Current Version**: v0.8.1 (BROKEN)
**Status**: BUILD SYSTEM BROKEN - Chat not connecting, CSS overflow unfixed

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL STATUS - HANDOFF TO NEXT AGENT

### What's Broken
1. **Background script**: Not receiving messages - "Could not establish connection"
2. **CSS overflow**: Text runs off screen despite fixes in source
3. **Build pipeline**: Changes don't propagate from source to dist
4. **Version management**: Updates don't reflect in running extension

### What Works
- Game data collection (8 villages parsing correctly)
- Chat UI appears
- Chat persistence (saves/loads messages)
- Vercel proxy endpoint exists

## Root Cause Analysis

### THE MAIN PROBLEM
```
src/content/index-fixed.ts imports './conversational-ai' (OLD)
                          should import './conversational-ai-fixed' (FIXED)
```

The fixed version with CSS and persistence improvements exists but ISN'T BEING USED.

### File Structure Reality
```
packages/extension/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/content/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ conversational-ai.ts (OLD - has overflow bug)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ conversational-ai-fixed.ts (FIXED - has CSS fixes, NOT IMPORTED)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts (imports OLD version)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index-fixed.ts (BUILD ENTRY - also imports OLD version!)
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content.js (built from index-fixed.ts with OLD chat)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ background.js (builds but doesn't connect)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ manifest.json
â””â”€â”€ build-minimal.sh (current build script)
```

## Immediate Fix Required

```bash
cd packages/extension

# 1. FIX THE IMPORT
sed -i "s|'./conversational-ai'|'./conversational-ai-fixed'|g" src/content/index-fixed.ts

# 2. REBUILD
./build-minimal.sh

# 3. RELOAD in Chrome
```

## Current Errors

### Content Script
```
[TLA Chat] Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')
```
- Happens at line 2175 in formatAIResponse
- Because background never responds (undefined response)

### Background Script  
```
Access to fetch at 'https://travian-proxy-simple.vercel.app/health' blocked by CORS
```
- Fixed in manifest but Chrome not recognizing the change

## Session Timeline

### What Happened (2 hours wasted)
1. Started with working v0.7.x that had minor issues
2. Created conversational-ai-fixed.ts with CSS and persistence fixes
3. Created game-start-optimizer.ts for settlement predictions
4. Build system stopped using the fixed version
5. Spent 2 hours trying to patch compiled JS instead of fixing source import
6. Multiple build scripts created, none reliable

### Build Scripts Created (all problematic)
- build-simple.sh (original, uses rollup with fallback)
- build.sh (tries to use Replit secrets)
- build-working.sh (doesn't work)
- build-minimal.sh (current, works but imports wrong file)

## What Doug Needs

1. **Chat that connects to AI** (was working in v0.7.x)
2. **Text that wraps properly** (fix exists, not being used)
3. **Reliable build** (one command, predictable output)
4. **Settlement optimization testing** (needs working chat first)

## For Next Agent - DO THIS FIRST

```bash
# CHECK WHAT'S BEING IMPORTED
grep "conversational-ai" src/content/index-fixed.ts

# If it shows './conversational-ai' (without -fixed):
sed -i "s|'./conversational-ai'|'./conversational-ai-fixed'|g" src/content/index-fixed.ts

# Then rebuild
./build-minimal.sh

# This should fix the CSS overflow issue
```

## Environment Variables
- TLA_BACKEND_URL = https://travian-proxy-simple.vercel.app
- TLA_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = [set in Replit secrets]

## Testing Instructions
1. Load extension from packages/extension/dist
2. Go to Travian game (lusobr.x2.lusobrasileiro.travian.com)  
3. Click chat button (bottom right)
4. Should connect and wrap text properly

## Previous Working State
- Version 0.7.11-0.7.14 had chat working
- Could send messages to Vercel proxy
- Some CSS issues but messages displayed

## Doug's Requirements
- Game start optimization (<7 day settlement)
- Must work in <2 hours gameplay per day
- Chat needs to analyze game state and provide strategy
- Currently has 8 villages to test with

---

**CRITICAL**: The fix is simple - wrong import in index-fixed.ts. Fix that and rebuild. Don't overthink it.
