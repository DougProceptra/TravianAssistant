# TravianAssistant Session Context
*Last Updated: September 2, 2025*

## Project Status: Backend Complete, Extension Needs Connection

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Backend Server (server.js)**
   - Running on Replit at port 3000
   - SQLite database with full schema
   - Game data loaded (8 buildings, 4 troops, 5 quests)
   - Multi-player support via hashed email IDs
   - Admin dashboard at `/admin.html`
   - All API endpoints functional

2. **Database Structure**
   - `villages` - World map data from map.sql
   - `user_villages` - Player-specific village data
   - `buildings`, `troops`, `quests` - Game mechanics data
   - `recommendations` - AI strategic advice storage
   - Each player identified by hashed email for privacy

3. **API Endpoints Ready**
   - `GET /health` - Server health check
   - `GET /api/all-players` - List all player IDs
   - `POST /api/village` - Save scraped village data
   - `GET /api/villages/:accountId` - Get player's villages
   - `GET /api/game-data` - Get game mechanics data
   - `POST /api/recommendation` - Save AI recommendations
   - `GET /api/recommendations` - Get recommendations

### ⚠️ Current Issues

1. **Replit URL Access Problem**
   - Server runs locally but external URL not working
   - Tried: `travianassistant.dougdostal.repl.co` (doesn't resolve)
   - Need to determine correct Replit public URL format
   - May need to use Deploy button for stable URL

2. **Chrome Extension Needs Update**
   - Extension exists in `/packages/extension/`
   - Has enhanced scraper (`enhanced-data-scraper.ts`)
   - Content script (`scraper-connector.ts`) ready but needs:
     - Correct `BACKEND_URL` to be set
     - Build and reload in Chrome
   - AI chat connected via Vercel proxy (working)

### 📋 Next Session Priority Tasks

1. **Fix Replit URL Access**
   ```bash
   # Check environment variables
   env | grep REPL
   # Try Deploy button for stable URL
   # Or investigate new Replit URL format (.replit.app)
   ```

2. **Update Chrome Extension**
   ```javascript
   // In scraper-connector.ts, update:
   const BACKEND_URL = 'https://[CORRECT-REPLIT-URL]';
   ```

3. **Test Data Flow**
   - Install extension in Chrome
   - Set user email (gets hashed)
   - Visit Travian page
   - Verify data reaches backend
   - Check admin dashboard

### 🏗️ Architecture Summary

```
Chrome Extension (each player)
    ↓ (scrapes game data)
Enhanced Scraper 
    ↓ (sends to backend)
Replit Backend (shared)
    ↓ (stores in SQLite)
Database (multi-player)
    ↓
Admin Dashboard (monitor all players)
```

### 👥 Multi-Player Design
- 3-5 players supported simultaneously
- Each player has unique hashed email ID
- Data completely isolated per player
- Admin dashboard shows all players
- AI recommendations per player

### 🔧 Technical Details

**Replit Setup:**
- `.replit` configured with `run = "npm start"`
- Ports: 3000 internal, maps to 80/3000 external
- Has workflow instructions in Agent panel

**File Locations:**
- Backend: `/server.js`
- Game Data: `/data/game-data.json`
- Admin Dashboard: `/admin.html`
- Extension: `/packages/extension/`
- Scraper: `/packages/extension/src/scrapers/enhanced-data-scraper.ts`
- Content Script: `/packages/extension/src/content/scraper-connector.ts`

**Environment:**
- Node.js 20
- SQLite via better-sqlite3
- Express server with CORS enabled
- Static file serving enabled

### 🎯 Success Criteria for Next Session
1. Get working public URL for Replit backend
2. Update extension with correct backend URL
3. Successfully scrape and store data from Travian
4. View player data in admin dashboard
5. Have at least one player's village data flowing

### 💡 Remember
- Don't manually start server with `npm start` 
- Use Replit's Run button or Deploy feature
- The server works perfectly locally, just need public URL
- All game data and API endpoints are ready
- Multi-player system fully implemented

### 🐛 Debugging Commands
```bash
# Check what's running
lsof -i :3000
lsof -i :3002

# Kill stuck processes
pkill -9 node

# Check Replit environment
env | grep REPL

# Test server locally
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Start server (if Run button fails)
PORT=3000 node server.js
```

### 📝 For Doug
The backend is complete and working. The only blocker is getting Replit's public URL working. Once that's resolved (likely through Deploy button or finding correct URL format), the entire system is ready for multi-player use. Each player just needs to install the extension and point it to your backend URL.
