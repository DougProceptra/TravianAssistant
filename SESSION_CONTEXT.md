# TravianAssistant Session Context
*Last Updated: August 21, 2025 - Multi-Village Issue Identified*

## 🎯 Current Focus
**Working on**: Multi-village data collection not working
**Version**: 0.4.6
**Priority**: Fix village navigation to collect all 6 villages

## 📊 Session Status
- **Backend**: ✅ Running at https://workspace.dougdostal.repl.co
- **Extension**: ✅ Working but only shows 1 village
- **AI Integration**: ✅ Claude Sonnet 4 responding
- **Issue**: ⚠️ Only analyzing current village, not all 6

## ✅ Today's Achievements (August 21, 2025)

### 1. Fixed Backend Port Conflict
- Removed hardcoded port 3002 for WebSocket
- WebSocket now shares same port as HTTP server
- Server running successfully on Replit

### 2. Added Missing Extension Files
- Created `content.css` for HUD styles
- Created `popup.html` and `popup.js` for extension popup
- Created `options.html` for settings page
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to copy all public files

### 3. Updated Backend URL
- Changed from `TravianAssistant.dougdostal.replit.dev`
- To: `workspace.dougdostal.repl.co`
- Extension now connects to correct backend

## 🐛 Current Issue: Multi-Village Support

### The Problem
- User has 6 villages in Travian
- Extension only shows "1 village" in HUD
- Only current active village is being analyzed
- Village switcher is a clickable list (not dropdown)

### What Should Happen
1. "Full Scan" button should navigate through all villages
2. Collect data from each village
3. Show aggregated stats in HUD
4. Display "6 villages" with total production/resources

### Code Status
- ✅ Multi-village code exists in `enhanced-scraper.ts`
- ✅ `village-navigator.ts` has navigation logic
- ❌ Navigation not being triggered properly
- ❌ Full scan only happens every 30 minutes automatically

### Screenshot Evidence
- Villages panel shows "Villages 6/6"
- List includes villages with different coordinates
- Each village clickable to switch
- HUD only reflects current village

## 🚀 Working Features

### Extension Features
- ✅ Quick Analyze - Analyzes current village
- ✅ Full Scan - Should analyze all villages (needs fix)
- ✅ AI Analysis - Gets Claude recommendations
- ✅ Ask Question - Chat interface with Claude
- ✅ Export/Copy data functions
- ✅ Backend sync to SQLite

### Backend Features
- ✅ HTTP API on port 3001
- ✅ WebSocket on same port
- ✅ SQLite database persistence
- ✅ Health endpoint working
- ✅ Village data storage

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### URLs and Endpoints
- **Backend API**: https://workspace.dougdostal.repl.co
- **Health Check**: https://workspace.dougdostal.repl.co/api/health
- **WebSocket**: wss://workspace.dougdostal.repl.co
- **Vercel Proxy**: https://travian-proxy-simple.vercel.app (for Claude)

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. Debug why `villageNavigator.collectAllVillagesData()` isn't working
2. Check if village clicking is being simulated properly
3. Ensure "Full Scan" button triggers navigation
4. Test with console commands to force multi-village scan

### Testing Commands
```javascript
// Force full account scan
window.TLA.scraper.scrapeFullAccount(true)

// Check current state
window.TLA.debug()

// See how many villages detected
window.TLA.navigator.getVillages()
```

## 💡 Important Notes

### Development Workflow
- All changes via Git commits (Doug's preference)
- Pull in Replit: `git pull origin main`
- Build extension: `cd packages/extension && pnpm build`
- Reload extension in Chrome after building

### Known Constraints
- Chrome Manifest V3 blocks direct API calls (hence proxy)
- Village switcher is clickable list, not dropdown
- Full scan takes time (need to visit each village)
- 30-minute auto-scan interval may be too long

## ✨ Summary
Extension is functional with AI integration working perfectly. Backend is running and storing data. Main issue is multi-village collection not navigating through all 6 villages. This is the next priority to fix.
