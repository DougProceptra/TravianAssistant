# TravianAssistant Session Context
*Last Updated: September 2, 2025 - Evening Session*

## Current Status
The extension is functional with AI chat working! The AI understands Travian context but needs more accurate game knowledge. The backend is complete and running on Replit.

## Architecture Status

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Chrome Extension**
   - HUD displays correctly with resources, population, CP
   - AI chat interface functional with debug window
   - Dynamic tribe detection (Romans, Egyptians, etc.)
   - Conversation memory maintaining context
   - Resources collection working (wood, clay, iron, crop)
   - Population detection working
   - Village coordinates displayed

2. **Backend Server (Replit)**
   - Running at: https://3a6514bb-7f32-479b-978e-cb64d6f1bf42-00-1j1tdn8b0kpfn.riker.replit.dev
   - SQLite database with full schema
   - Game data loaded (buildings, troops, quests)
   - Multi-player support via account IDs
   - All API endpoints functional

3. **AI Integration (Vercel Proxy)**
   - Proxy at: https://travian-proxy-simple.vercel.app/api/proxy
   - Successfully forwarding to Anthropic API
   - System prompt with expert-recommended structure
   - Conversation history maintained

### ⚠️ Current Issues

1. **AI Response Accuracy**
   - Confuses Palace vs Residence for settlers
   - Wrong settler costs (says 5800/4400/4600/5800, should be 5800/4400/5200/4600 for Romans)
   - Incorrect CP values (Main Building level 10 doesn't give 690 CP/day)
   - Missing Travian-specific mechanics (adventures, daily quests, hero)

2. **Data Collection Gaps**
   - Culture points per day not scraped (shows as "-/day")
   - Hero stats not populating (level, attack, defense all show "-")
   - Server day might be defaulting to 1 (needs verification)

3. **System Prompt Needs Enhancement**
   - Missing exact building costs and CP generation tables
   - No adventure system information
   - No daily quest rewards data
   - Missing NPC merchant mechanics

## System Prompt Analysis

### Current Structure (Good)
```
You are an expert AI assistant for Travian Legends
## ROLE AND OBJECTIVE - ✅ Clear
## DATA PROVIDED - ✅ Live game state
## CAPABILITIES & LIMITATIONS - ✅ Advisory only
## THINKING PROCESS - ✅ 5-step process
## OUTPUT FORMAT - ✅ Structured advice
```

### What's Missing (Needs Adding)
- Exact CP generation per building level table
- Tribe-specific settler costs
- Building prerequisites tree
- Adventure rewards and hero leveling
- Daily quest importance
- NPC merchant ratios

## Test Results from Last Query

**User**: "I am starting a new server as a roman. What are the first 10 tasks?"

**AI Issues Observed**:
1. First response was generic strategy game advice
2. Second response better but had wrong settler info
3. Third response about CP had inflated values

**What AI Got Right**:
- Understood it was Travian Legends (eventually)
- Knew Romans need crop focus
- Mentioned correct buildings for CP

**What AI Got Wrong**:
- Palace vs Residence confusion
- Settler costs incorrect
- CP values way too high
- No mention of adventures or daily quests

## Priority Fixes for Next Session

### 1. Immediate - System Prompt Enhancement
Add exact game data tables:
```javascript
// Add to system prompt:
BUILDING CP GENERATION:
- Main Building L10: 83 CP/day
- Marketplace L10: 35 CP/day
- Embassy L10: 48 CP/day
// etc.

SETTLER COSTS BY TRIBE:
- Romans: 5800/4400/5200/4600
- Gauls: 5500/4400/5300/4900
// etc.
```

### 2. Short Term - Better Scraping
Find selectors for:
- `.culture_points .production` - CP per day
- `.heroImage[title]` - Hero level from tooltip
- `.serverTime .started` - Actual server start date

### 3. Medium Term - Tool Integration
Implement game data query tool so AI can ask:
- "What's the cost of Main Building level 5?"
- "How much CP does Embassy level 3 give?"
- "What are Roman troop stats?"

## Files Structure

```

## Debug Commands
```javascript
// Browser console - Check scraped data:
document.querySelector('#ta-pop').textContent
document.querySelector('#ta-cp').textContent
document.querySelector('#ta-cp-rate').textContent
document.querySelector('#ta-server-day').textContent

// View system prompt:
document.querySelector('.ta-debug-btn').click()

// Check game data in memory:
window.TravianHUD?.gameData
```

## Success Metrics
1. ✅ AI understands Travian context
2. ⚠️ AI provides accurate costs/values (needs exact data)
3. ✅ AI maintains conversation context
4. ❌ AI gives optimal build orders (needs game formulas)
5. ⚠️ AI adapts to server age (needs better day detection)

## Next Session Action Plan

### Step 1: Add Exact Game Data
Create comprehensive data tables for system prompt:
- All building costs by level
- All CP generation values
- Settler costs per tribe
- Building prerequisites
- Quest rewards

### Step 2: Improve Scraping
Test and implement selectors for:
- CP production rate
- Hero attributes
- True server age
- Building queue status

### Step 3: Test & Iterate
Run test queries:
- "What are my first 10 tasks as Romans?"
- "How many days until I can settle?"
- "Should I build Embassy or Marketplace for CP?"

## Configuration

## Session Achievement Summary
✅ Got AI working with Travian context  
✅ Implemented expert-recommended prompt structure  
✅ Set up conversation memory  
✅ Created debug tools  
⚠️ Need exact game data for accuracy
